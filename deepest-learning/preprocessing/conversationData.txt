mountain there's a big tech boom in utah right now lots of hiring opportunities if there's a specific place he's interested in i can probably provide some contacts and networking opportunities but he should be able to come up with some places he's interested in um so do you know how this maid of the most is going to work this line is wow no idea how long feel free to go on without us auto-generated message: collin burton has left this conversation and will no longer see your messages thought you'd want to know that byron warner is the new bishop vilchinsky is first councilor and spencer rice is second councilor this is their mba program yes oh sorry for some reason i thought you had bought it wow we live in a 900sq ft apartment for just slightly less and that's subsidized it should be over twice that how'd you get such a good deal the landlords like to hand pick their tenants hey you post about gay marriage and racism is going crazy people seem to be confusing the word "right" with privilege the only rights we have are in the bill of rights (speech religion privacy etc) everything else is a privilege (voting driving etc) so if marriage in general is not a right then constitutionally there is no protection for either side stop calling it a right in reality government has no place in marriage in the first place what do you think is this a huge example of failure in public knowledge of basic civics i mean honestly if marriage is a true right then all of the ugly and dysfunctional people should be marching in the streets demanding that the government provide the with a spousethoughts heading off to church i'll respond later that's fantastic texas roads are too small who said everything here is big have you stopped at the czech stop yet very nice glad to hear

which competition adobe 25ee think of it this way homosexuals have sex with the same gender don't worry about numbers heterosexuals have sex with mixed gender homo = same hetero = mixed so which one has the mixed genotype you got through the run so that is a good sign i would do two runs going as far as you can get and stop when/if it starts hurting well i made it a whole 10 miles today i stopped and stretched frequently and went slow but i got through it just saw a video of cannibal at lagoon i must ride that coaster come on out you have a ride buddy i guess they have a couple appts to see a

me convince my landlord to let me sublet convince my wife to let someone live here i checked with a recruiter who is very involved with hiring for analysts in people operations (hr) and she said there

lot of opportunity i found a newsletter you might like it's like financial news got together with your tumblr page and had a love child themsbcheatsheetcom they aren't streaming spencer wells though

offer are you feeling ready for 2nd year getting ready for the rafting trip ;) internship went great they hired me to do manufacturing but i ended up making a personalized product recommender similar to what they use at amazon they are going to hire me as a contractor during school to keep improving it be there in 2 hey i'm sorry getting approval for your project is taking so long that is awesome that you want to go to grad school out here what are you studying i am working in sd right now and trying to figure out what i want to go to grad school for i am definitely going to go but i don't want to spend money on a subject i am not interested in you know ok have a great day and talk to you later alligoator i'm probably going to do something in the biosciences either molecular biology or biochemistry the nice thing about the bio fields right now is that you don't have to pay to go in fact they pay you you get about 20-30k a year for a living stipend as well as health insurance i just heard about pharmacy school yesterday too and i'm looking into it starting salaries are near 100k a year it's really easy to get into a program and it only takes 3 years to complete i guess i'm going to have to do some soul searching and figure out exactly what i want to do i'm going to sd for thanksgiving can't wait to get back to the beach so the answer is 25 ee and 25 ee this is so over my head but there are no e and e they are all either ee ee or ee what is the proportion of e to e in the population sry it says you need to sign up for google+ peg the price at $250/hour you'll find time with that :) i bet what internship were you looking at again see if you can see all the pictures now :) what are you doing on the genealogy side thanks hope yours was nice too i don't get this it looks

addiction awesome ready for your race shouldnt you be in bed i've been asleep in the love sack yes you will my first week of real work felt like an extended case competition and i thought "where are all my friends i'm used to working with on these problems" but alas they're all at their own jobs now ;) time to make new friends and make a new team right this time they aren't forced to work with you so the frequency is 50%e and 50% e or would it just be 1 to 1 yes that's the answer although i'm not sure you get the concept 50% e 50% e i might still be active if i didn't live here if people don't feel like they can go to the salt palace the are streaming a bunch of the sessions cool i'll mention that indeed that's the fellow i'm sure dad will be booking the temple tomorrow morning how's life going for you are you still in florida glad to see you're on facebook who did you say was the pluralsight employee that wanted to get a team going debbie i'm liking the idea of selling in the break room i wouldn't feel comfortable with asking william to load the snow cone machine into his food truck and adding snow cones to his menu for a one day event i suppose there is the entry way where they serve the christmas breakfast or perhaps in the loading dock i'm about done with this health department stuff though starting to seem like more trouble than it's worth congratulations thanks i might need to try that back flip tomorrow now it looks like we were in atlanta at the same time thanks realistically how long would this course actually take - it says 10 weeks it depends on how many hours a day you want to put into it the fraud section is pretty self contained so if you want to just to that you would get a lot out of it then it is 1 to 1 what percentage haha working hard right now what have you been working on yep i've never met either of them lemme see what i can do i just saw your adobe nail art picture on facebook it looks awesome i'm sure it will get some attention it reminded me about these nail wraps my wife sells from jamberry i think you can make custom designs with them too it could be another media for you to express yourself with take a look at kcburtonjamberrycom if the idea interests you currently i'm working at myriad genetics in product development i work with robot testing as well as some more molecular biology stuff it's a great job

on the past 5 months post with no explanations so sorry i fell for it too looking forward to your post ahhh got it we'll need to get lunch soon you bet well i used to take students to nyc every other year and then the kids stopped signing up i had to get at least 12 signed up for a trip to "make" kids started saying "i'll just go next year" i teach in one of the poorest districts in texas so it is difficult for most kids to travel and this company call acis just kind of kept tabs on me for the last several years they do not do group travel to nyc they only do international travel they would invite me to things to meet them they would check in on me not too pushy but always available and i got an offer to meet at one of my favorite restaurants and breweries in austin so i went and as they say "i drank the kool aid" i decided to try for 6 travelers to london then i would get a free trip six is easier than twelve but i put together a theatre tour of london and my kids that could go were not my theatre kids they were my other students they said if you went to paris i would go and if you went to rome i would go so i revamped the trip and now i'm taking people-students and adults to london paris and rome in july acis had two contests if i sold at least 6 trips before june of 2015 i would get a free weekend training trip to barcelona yay and without my knowledge they do a raffle of all kids registered for trips company wide that is at least hundreds maybe thousands of students i think only students qualify i don't think they put in anyone who was not either in high school or college and one of my students was picked so his trip to europe this summer is free it couldn't happen to a better kid i just adore the kid that won and because he won they gave me a free trip to barcelona and i got the other free trip for getting enough travelers so a trip for me and a companion to barcelona well i have a dear friend who made it possible for me to escape from my ex-husband and keep my location a secret and she's responsible for getting my legal help to get divorced and finally she give me a place to live so it was easy to pick her to go with me as the other free trip i so badly wanted to take my daughter or son but cassidy my daughter is trying to get funded to spend this summer in london with the royal shakespeare company she was invited to audition and she got a scholarship but she needs to raise the money to get there and for living expenses while she's there because she can't work over there so free training weekend in barcelona-my first trip overseas those comments are perfect i already have tickets to la sagrada familia i'm staying close to gothic quarter i think that is awesome it couldn't have happened to a better person i'll be waiting for pictures

so much he just got into glee i can ask though ok i dont hv drop box all i see is foxey chashing colons race car i think what's happening is dropbox will only show 15 minutes if you watch it on your web browser if you click on download up in the top right you should be able to download the whole thing to your computer thats around what i was thinking and other than the screen it works pretty well yeah i'll send a pic they sent it to us for the adobe forum for fly back interviews fantastic i found the hiring manager on linkedin yeah hows that at least for the mbas 50 to 60 hour weeks are pretty normal they have a very intense culture surely you are joking about statistics i love stats and they are big in business right now the stats class you too was horrible but i took 2 others that were really good yeah well i am still not sure whether i'm going or not but in case i don't go i didn't wanted to give you proper notice i haven't signed up for nshmba yet but i'll probably go there i just decided that i'm going i still need to put plans together as well que tengas suerte right that's what i thought didn't seem like they wanted to support with $ just product i don't know about you but it's going to take a little more than a couple of samples of a $1 product to get me to promote it launch it you'll see some rooms pick a trivia room that's empty and i'll join you in a minute plug the headphones that came with your phone in have you done notes on blindness yet on the gear vr it's pretty long but really good no idea hey lori where did you stay in yellowstone i'm trying to find places but things look pretty booked haha yeah my signature my wife's signature and my sisters signature for whatsapp 8016363261 i'm here sounds fun count me in i probably won't be there at 8but i'll stop by for a bit so do you think that once you do the first ones the others will be easier or will it be 3-4 hours every time it's just the first one that will be hard after that i expect it will go really fast like a few minutes i'm padding the 3-4 hours a bit as well thanks man i will do that asap you got an official looking letter from the federal student aid program here that you may want to pick up dang i didn't know it was a presentation like this how'd it go i think it went pretty well the cmo of purple asked if i was interested in consulting nice which way are you going we spaced out our drive to allow for slightly longer stopovers in chicago and cleveland which were hugely beneficial for both us and the kids going i 80 i wish we had time for longer stopovers but we are about a day and a half late to make that happen was there any major construction along the way anything that's a must see cleveland will only by about 30 minutes away from us and chicago is about 5 hours so we probably won't stop there on the way out we could try to recruit people it might already be sold out i'll have to check sometimes you can buy someone's team when they drop out good luck on your venture down opera lane hope you enjoy the journey thanks edge or not also i checked and caleb is tall enough for canibal at lagoon getting him to ride it is another matter not edge it's corporate so they won't pay for fancy stuff well if collin is willing to help out a little with funding we might be able to get the venue and the rest of the things right now we have $18000 in checks and i found a really cool place to order tickets online we could just sell tickets and not worry about invites it's not just funding that i'm talking about i want to help lead this thing and get people excited about it so that they will actually show up bree is not always online i can tell you this much the venue is $60000 and right now i have only collected about $18000 so far from four people is the $600 what the whole thing will cost food dj decorations etc or is that just the deposit just so you know i'm not trying to complain here i know you guys are starting to burn out on this and i want to help out i'd like to see something happen on friday night and i'm willing to help make that happen i sent him a thank you email to that address that was the email we had coordinated the interview through so i'm guessing he didn't get the thank-you then the reason i assumed it was working even though the odd format was because he emailed me from it a couple times if he was responding from there he probably saw it then i've never had to use the recruiting app before so i don't know how it works how long is the commute to west valley 15-20 minutes maybe in a car thanks for writing and letting me know what she said and for the hint i would definitely like to ask her out and i think i will this sunday if she goes to the helix ward does she have a facebook account if she doesn't then you should tell her to get one anyways if you talk to her then tell her not to let any of the other guys from the ward take her out i'm just kiddingsort of talk to you later i don't think she has facebook right now good luck on your date let me know how it goes chris hey christine i have a friend that is working on a business phd at oxford she's looking for people that have recently retired to answer a few questions to help with a paper she's working on do you think you or your husband would be interested i put time off on the schedule but theres never a guarantee ill get it i requested the 27 and 28th off it should be a fun weekend you just wanted to do the bottom up approach right the format seems very odd to me is that normal though thanks that's the one from the program that handles all of the resumes his real email is cho@myriadcom actually-- stand by susan will not be there and i definitely want her to hear it might have to wait until after the gala are you around i should be ahh - that at least sounds reasonable for ragnar we are meeting at 3am haha love it 30 was a good year for you here's to making 31 even better just wanted to tell you that i love you from now to eternity mwah xoxoxo once upon a time there was a boy who hated dating he had just about given up when he decided to give it one more chance he went to a party at a friends house and there he met the most amazing girl this girl hated dating too and had been burned a few times but at the last minute she too decided to give dating one last chance and went to the party there she met the most amazing boy after the party they both knew that it was the start of something amazing(you pick up the story from here) check out this new facebook app that way you can high five hug dropkick etc me dont worry i'll get you back get it @ http://appsfacebookcom/superpokey i got karate chopped and head butted by you that hurts i hope you feel better now though i deleted it so my phone could be exclusively a work tool downloaded it on my tablet but don't know how to link them so i'll get my base back hmm i'm thinking of switching to a different task force for a bit lol i feel ya i'm back so i think one thing that we need to address is the venue one concern i have is that there won't be enough space there's a lot of people coming from out of town and they won't just come and go because then they might miss seeing someone alexis do you know how much it would be to get a room that was twice the size at the marina room cool how many offers did you get and did you think of a team name no offers yet but i did get invited to 7 parties no problem i totally understand thanks for all you do :-)) do you have crystal's number 8017839170 good to know i didn't know that i don't have an internal referral yet how'd your interview go i have a second interview with ebay next week hope all is well they said no they wanted someone with more statistics ability it looks like i might be going to symantec in lindon now best of luck with ebay all my phone ones have been 45 mins and this is only 9-1 for my mba ones they are usually 20 minutes or so amazon was 2 15 minute interviews in the first round and 2 30 minute interviews in the second round cool i get done around 2 and was planning on heading to the airport afterward but should have a few minutes in between what is your number and i can call when i'm done 8016363261 i'm working at myriad it's only a 5 minute drive from huntsman monday afternoon 3 hours onsite ok that gives some time for him to respond he usually gets back to me same day ohhh i thought it was just one add/drop deadline per semester good to know at least i hope so because i'm signed up for a 2nd block class that i'm planning on dropping later thanks a lot will you have some time early next week i think so i'm heading to ces on wednesday so i will be pretty busy during the day there 👍🏻 can i send you something by email i got dejohn to send me a detailed email about the success he's had after graduating from high school don't show them madagascar 3 - unless you think circus afro is hysterical which it is ah ok ;-) you said salt lake didn't have any high priced dinning options the actual gala event should be over around 8 or 8:30 there is a survivor celebration after in the next room but we did not attend that but you are invited to go people will come to

friday are ok as well if you'd rather do something earlier my schedule is really flexible this semester yeah that's the thing your brother needs to educate himself too btw glee is not a gay thing lol it's pretty camp but camp does not necessarily mean gay camp camp is what i went to in boy scouts yeah the glee comment was meant to be a little tongue in cheek nice hopefully something comes of it i just figured it couldn't hurt just got off the phone with your dad again he basically just offered me an internship in operations analytics his head of hr is designing a compensation package that's clever i did not love atlanta but savannah is likely more classic yeah atlanta is not great they have an amazing aquarium that has the only whale sharks in the us and there's the world of coke exhibit but that's about it no dietary restrictions i decided not to open it up to everyone this time- but was thinking of seeing if another old mission buddy could join i know tyler jeffs is in utah not sure how close to slc i'm open to suggestions since i'm not sure off the top of my head all who are in utah :) ok i'll think of something good there's lots of places up here now are we still on for dinner

special - i'm going to do the mba at the u at night starting in january i did well on the gmat which made me want to apply to a bunch of dream schools but i couldn't justify leaving my job and getting into all the debt school is so expensive i took a bunch of practice tests and they were very helpful the test is pretty tough and as i'm sure you know is designed to make you feel like you're doing terrible i finished thinking i would have to retake for sure but i beat my goal by 80 pts i was so relieved i wish you the best of luck i received a call from the university of utah confirming they'd received a letter from you thanks again sorry that last bit was for president davies not youwhoops what score did you get if you don't mind me asking i've got a gre score that's a 650 equivalent but

this family and the name barbara nice what prompted the change symantec started turning my job into basic reporting instead of the advanced stuff i like to do it would be at least a year until they switched back the 30% raise that pluralsight offered didn't hurt either hedi mora what would be a good opera to take caleb to he's 8 now so many operas deal with adult themes that he's not ready for yet more the analytics then there can be lots of that in marketing with the research esp in myriad's neck of the woods lots of stats i'm pretty good at stats black belt in six sigma and some other

what i thought but was not sure sorry to have ruffled your buddies feathers by questioning his superior intellect ;) i felt i was asking a legitimate question of what to do after we can no longer use

quick question for you you did the mba and the biology masters right i am thinking i might follow in your footsteps getting pretty jealous about those job offers you keep posting 󾌳 i did my recommendation just get the mba work experience counts more than the masters if you are interested in the byu mba program i can get you in touch with some of our recruiters or i'm happy to answer any questions did he do it on purpose he ran into me on purpose but i don't think he gets the significance might be too cold for that right january the science museum is pretty cool they have one of the apollo landing capsules ok let me know what you find i can look too i'm here in orlando now if you want me to check anyplace in person let me know also the public transportation here isn't great where

reunion at and where i didn't serve with president clark but i know a lot of people who did maybe i'll stop by starting time and place i have to come from riverton the traffic may be crazy i sent you a calendar invite ill try again okay should be there now had to create a new account seems like its impossible to change from one country to another with the same account i got it thanks i took your advice (& your dad's) and download windows 10 (so did a co-worker) neither one of us could print after that our printer is a ricoh it's 8 years old we had to take windows 10 back off our computers 🤔 i'm impressed that you have an 8 year old printer that still works doing great just finished 3/4 of the program taking a spring break for one week those are nice i miss them i'm not sure - i will know once i put up my blog post(s) discussing all of this maybe we can come up with a way to split the revenue even over adobe they are launching 8 new products into retail and they want the interns to learn and largely drive the process it would be great experience what project did you work on that had >1000 variables where do you find a data set like that bio informatics it was a dna micro array 1000 variables was the compressed/aggregated version the whole dataset probably had at least a million i'm liking it :) i would say 85% chance i come back full time how about you it's been interesting i'll probably look for other things when i go back a lot of people work remotely which means maybe i'll get some part time work during the year oh i guess i did or did you it said it was from you shoot looks like it is this is the first time this has happened i'm a first year mba and i'm going to a career symposium at the life science college next week to represent the marriott school do you

yes you i think we were in the same first grade class and middle school we played wipeout at our 6th grade graduation thank you very much good luck with the dancing thought you might like this it's great to keep up the old spanish skills yeah fixed it it was an auto fillin from fb how was the ride real nice lots of fun for my first group ride sounds like what i did fora long time you could set yourself apart by bribing in the stats skills yeah that's the plan i just have to see where it fits in the data scientist they had on hand that jeff really liked left the day before i got here i'll let you know i want to point a webcam at the house and do a virtual stake out i hear you and in theory it makes sense but not having sex before marriage is not analogous to not having sex when you're gay agreed it would be a tough challenge to deal with but i'm sure pretty sure there's a handful of mormons who manage to do it xo/ colleen i'm doing really well here in utah i have 2 semesters left of undergrad after this one and then it's off to grad school there's a pretty good chance that i'll go to ucsd i'll finally be back in sd again i will miss the utah snow the skiing out here is out of

movie but i imagine it's something like the 40 year old virgin heard of it haven't played it yet it does sound like fun but you're right i don't have an android phone come over to the dark side :-)

again have a good night you wanna do lunch today you'll have to text me with a response because they block facebook at my work 8016363261 oh wow - well i'm so glad that worked out then it's data analytics you're in right data science is a hot field right now gotta jump on when you can hey collin how did you see my resume that's awesome i can give you a call tonight if that's okay i have an interview this afternoon that i'm just about to go to thanks you applied to be a validation project manager and i'm a validation project manager at myriad tonight is good good luck on your interview we have a lot of positions open for lab techs but if you don't have the classes there's still another one that could work hey jamie just thought i'd let you know about the job the validation project manager isn't going to work out there's some other jobs that could work you might work out as a lab tech you only need 6 credits of biology 6 of chem and 12 more credits of any science those messages went out backwards on that the thing is that myriad is the only one with the knowledge/database to know which mutations are pathogenic and which ones aren't there are some that have been published but others that myriad only had has it's not as big a factor as they say it is and it will be quickly replaced as more people offer testing dang so don't pick up any women on the side of the road great to know i'll keep watching them good luck with your first day coming up thanks from what i know so far they will probably end up in salt lake county possibly as far south as draper or as far north as salt lake city midvale has also come up they are actively researching sites at the moment but nothing concrete there will probably be a short term solution in the mean time because they are already bursting at the seams i'm talking with a vp on friday to try and get more info but that's all i know for now we had some car issues that i had to fix this morning and we just got a message from the hotel saying we can check in early so we're going to go drop off our stuff and then head up kids have been having many melt downs on out end collin whtat's up man hey am i ever gonna get my phone cable back no worries just wondering thanks for reminding me i kinda forgot i had it i'll drop it by tomorrow i wasn't sure if you were back yet you probably got the email from scott and i know you've already signed up for the team i initially created see if you can switch your ticket to byu mba 1 if you have any issues let me know and i'll contact the organizers about it it was great seeing you at nathaniel's wedding tonight i know you'll do great at ibm atlanta will be fantastic go say hi to the whale sharks in the aquarium for me let me know if you hear about any cool analytics products coming out of ibm collin，can u send the request again my friend didnot have any requirement in his system i used a different phone number it works now thanks for the help we are working in provo living in orem where in utah will you guys end up with your new job still debating right now leaning towards kaysville office is in farmington but growing so fast they are running out of room and will move sometime soon don't know where they are going yet it's actually the internal version where i can say what everything is instead of the de-identified version i'll present to everyone else details on the new job gotcha - that makes sense facebook is like a college party i'm sure you'll do great at either remember when i broke your surfboard yeah i kept the tail section until i got married and my wife made me throw it away hola eres elder burton que sirvio en badajoz yo soy cecilia no se si te acuerdas te escribo desde el profile de mi esposo hace tiempo que no sé nada de la gente que sirvio por badajoz byeee it was great seeing you again i'm glad to hear that grad school is looking very positive in your future best of luck in your next adventure i look forward to seeing where you end up sounds good nope i did not gopracticing cases will be at the lounge are you on campus no i'm at nbmbaa i also like 'hansel and gretel' by humperdink and 'the magic flute' by mozart caleb likes rossini william tell overture is one of his favorites yeah the mountains are in la right well resident salary is like 50k lol so i'll be dirt poor good point la has some "skiing" in the mountain nearby but it's pretty icy san francisco has skiing that's probably 2-3 hours away that's better lake tahoe is nearby thanks she told me that she always seems to be able to make time for friends so i'll think we'll be able to work something out so i finally got to hang out with your cousin we only hung out for about an hour and a half so we didn't have a whole bunch of time to talk however it went well and we had plenty to talk about i could see some differences between us but i would like to go out with her again in case you're wondering the differences i was referring to were things about politics and some interests i don't remember how we started talking about politics but she seems to be quite liberal and i'm more on the conservative side also she's a vegetarian i'm not a big meat fan but i probably would never completely stop eating meat anyways i would like to go out again and get to know her better i think this is the type of relationship in which it would be much better to just be friends for awhile and then move on to a dating instead of dating first before being friends i think you're right about the relationship thing she really just needs friends right now i think anyway thanks for being her friend really we have a free trial going on our whole website right now through the 22nd you should check it out oh sorry wrong person 😬 had a typo 6lb 13oz <3 it's more expensive but you'd be a doctor at a pretty prestigious place so cost of living shouldn't be much of an issue hahathat's okay yeah i don't have that many credits in bio unfortunately :( i kind of told karen where i was ati'm struggling at figuring out what i want to doand i'm really half hearted when it comes science jobs right now i kind of just applied for the job because my brother-in-law pressured me a little bit :) sotruthfully i'm not that excited about a lab job :) ok there's another non-science job i could recommend you for it's a data technician you basically gather all the results from all the tests and assemble everything for the final report it's not technical at all but i bet your six sigma and lean knowledge could be used to really improve the process you should come and check out my profile i'm getting married on september 22nd in san diego and i want to send you an invite but i need your address hows life with two kids usually pretty good but tonight's been tough lot's of crying np not your fault are you going to do the club that abhisheik and shaun are starting terrific thanks let's plan on saturday just gazpacho would you be up for a tortilla too whoop-whoop he's here 6lb 13oz 185inches yep - i'll send you mine to start with but i want to do a few ok sure thanks collin https://symantecwd1myworkdayjobscom/en-us/university/job/usa---california-mountain-view---hq/product-manager_36836source=170 https://wwwlinkedincom/in/lyndsay-smith-5708a33/ can you still see the job listing i think it might have been taken down ok cool do you want me to send it to you here as a message or email it too you email would be best thanks let me see if i can change that - just a sec does this link work they have some other genomics related jobs too i'm borderline qualified i'm still a year out from full time employment though thanks for thinking of me do you know anyone that works at ancestrydna yup going on 13 years which is crazy the gravitational pull of the city has been very strong same here with utah it's like a black hole every time i fly into chicago i can't get over how big it is i have 4 clients for wedding invites so i am working on that designing or envelope stuffing yes it did apparently sorry about that i'm in the process of taking care of it hi christie do you have the login credentials for the youtube byu analytics account my video on there has almost 3k views now i'm curious what the analytics say about who is watching no unfortunately not i will be in the final stages of studying for the illinois bar exam which is the last week of july too bad it would have been fun to meet up ok i'm cracking up i love those race tracks- seriously i want one for my kids they were so fun and who videos people for so long cutting a gooey pie/cake your mom is so pretty it's so great to see these videos thanks for sharing- it means a lot to me ok i got like 15 min worth of video and it seems to repeat too hmm i'll look into it tomorrow we are registered at target i saw you were in the instant pot community it's in sale for $70 today do you like yours and do you think i could convince karen to use it sorry for the delayi had another interview and they offered me the job it's part time thoughso i'm debating what i'm going to do what is the data technician position like hours full time location 8 to 5 m-f is the regular hours but there is quite a bit of temporary overtime at the moment it's in research park you could ride the red line all the way up to the university and then it's a 10 minute walk as far as the work goes it's not as exciting as working at a mine i'm sure but it is important work you would be the final step before a patient report gets sent out the turnover in the job seems pretty low so it looks like people enjoy it working at myriad itself is great because there are a lot of really big things happening and there is a lot of growth hey jamie i need your help with a christmas present for karen oh cool let's do this ok what's your number i'll call you later 8016363261 /googl/maps/cvwurekj7uw we'll bring some bubbles for kids to play with too running about 15 minutes late that's kinda hard if we get a flood in that following week i made the mistake of posting on the wall to early and got my head cut off we won't be posting anything till the 1st lol event brite has integrated refunds should that happen ha ha ok in salt lake rite yes lol how was your weekend not bad my wife got a flat tire today i've worked with his few times and yes he brings new perspective and talent but usually he doesnt have much time i'm guessing you are trying to win this and not just do it for fun and travis as well :) and more to come i guess that's crazy your father was my friend too i just friended him my younger sister had a crush on him growing up god bless you nice to hear from you i'd love to hear more stories about my mom some time i should go by and just knock this weekend don't you think yeah worth a shot it is ending fast my last day is aug 7th just a couple more weeks then i really like it feel very lucky i saw this http://jobsjobvitecom/careers/insidesales/job/oh874fwk__jvst=insidesalescom if you're at all interested let me know thanks i'm actually announcing today that i've accepted a data scientist position at pluralsight thanks for thinking of me though ben chapman might be interested in this though mind if i pass it along your mom jenny seemed sort of progressive my dad is very much a go with the flow kind of guy they would copy us ;) thought you might like this it's great to keep up the old spanish skills :) good night there's no uber at the airport at this moment i'll try to figure out how to get to your place hmm keep me posted his name is scott long i'm not 100% sure that's the company he works with but i think it may be ok did you ever meet diana she ran on the first ragnar team she's a patient speaker for biogen as well as myriad please dont cure cancer that eventually starts the zombie revolution how accurate is the test at least 99% we stop measuring once we get to 99 because it takes too many samples after that ohnice *oh nice what part i'll be in cleveland akron on eof my favorite recruiters is from abbott let me know if you ever want an introduction we didn't work together in 2002 it was this year hey are you still in utah if you are and are looking for a job my old position at myriad is available and i think you would be a good fit for it yeah totally we are working on it right now so you'll have to come to our next concert and maybe we will dedicate it to you two or something ha and hopefully it will live up to your expectations :) that would be awesome haha - nice i heard a brief interview with him online some people said he came off to churchy he mentioned faith but it wasn't sunday schooly his radio west interview airs tomorrow kali is awesome i personally love metasploit and armitage too much fun in the lab i have parrotos installed on my toshiba laptop it's been amazing so far i'm going to be constructing an entire hyperv isolated lab environment with both parrotos and kali as well as owasp and metasploitable vms that's a lot of jargon soup for me i'm still new at this i just found out what kali linux was about 20 minutes ago night i think i might try a silent alarm clock tomorrow i am setting up an encrypted password vault so i can finally stop doing the horrible insecure practice that most people do nice i've been using lastpass for a few years now works amazingly ahh the "re-coming out" so here's something you probably din't know i told my parents i was gay during high school i think i was 15 so like

doing most of the research on the truax line she didn't recognize the names you mentioned but she will take a brief look everything she has found has been from ancestrycom i suggest you start there

search and rescue did you end up going to the friendsgiving thing on saturday i ended up being sick so i couldn't make it is there something about him particular that makes him more likely than not on the genetic side i think there's some people who do have more of a choice but i don't see my brother as one haha yeah grand island is in ny crazy crowded here probably - i will ask he said he just accessed excel files on his mac but that he would look and see which r packages he used - does that make sense to you can you send me the data i'm pretty sure i can do this i was thinking families too but am good either way same here hey are you in marriage prep on monday and wednesday evenings i thought i saw you in there this last time hey andy i'm considering taking a job at symantec in lindon i'd love to hear your thoughts on the company could we set up a call today or sometime this week i'm open from 12-2 and after 5 today if that works what van were you in i was runner 12 the first time and runner 1 the second time van 2 was a lot better i thought what runner were you this last run hey collin thank you for making the intro with ben we couldn't find a time to meet (bummer) i had the interview monday and i thought it went well fingers crossed best of luck if you ever want to meet him in person he's usually at the deep learning meetup that happens once a month yeah it got tagged right i just retweeted it great looking photo i just saw that adobe posted an advanced analytics internship in san jose do you have any contacts out there your contact was great thank you he also mentioned how he wants to get you at genentech ft awesome mike is a great guy i'm glad he hasn't lost faith in me yet 😉 i and about 7 other people interviewed at cicero last semester i've heard the term thrown around a few times but haven't heard anything concrete yet the ward may not even have an activities person called yet if it doesn't pan out you're welcome up here ok no problem i got in collin what about u yep i did it will be fun to work together next year do you know if anyone else did thanks collin i hope so i'm stopping by adobe today i second the faldmo nomination i mean bishop faldmo sounds good to me you can send the goat to graze in central park can you ping me the location i will send it to my friend my wife is hesitant to give out our exact address but it's very close to 3900 s 2700 e good luck on your test i don't know what laura's email address is so i'm sending this message to you ok so we played a little joke and put the pictures online which was wrong and i'm sorry but lauren's reaction to all of this is completely immature she had no right to be physically violent towards adam or towards anyone in our apartment all of the pictures have been removed and in my opinion laura owes adam an apology for her behavior i just wanted to see if you got the email i sent you it was to an older address so i'm not sure if it went through i'm quitting apx today the best decision of my life it's amazing are you going to work close to alejandro romero yes he was one of my interviewers really and there are enough cool games/things to be worth it i'm excited for you yeah i think this is what it must have felt like for our grandparents when they watched tv for the first time i like t-mobile s pricing for plans too i just ordered my s7 my work is giving me one what is jen's last name @ huntsman i need to find out where to send a check and a form for donation matching from norfolk railroad murano does that mean you'll move your family to boston or is it an online course the new mall is here http://googl/maps/tgy7m if i got in i would move my family lol no i think maybe one or two people in high school knew mvhs was diverse but not progressive it's possible that people assumed but it definitely wasn't something that i advertised i mean the most important thing for me then was telling my parents but anywaythere's a point that relates to the "re-coming out" that i referenced so i came out to my parents very earlydid not date anyone until halfway through college and it was interesting to see their reaction when i first introduced someone to themthat definitely made it more "real" they ultimately were/are finepretty amazingly actually but my advice to your brother regarding bring someone home if/when he gets there make sure the person is amazing (if possible) i mean someone who really has their shit together that is virtually impossible to not like/love it might be a while he is living in small town michigan at the moment he said the dating pool is pretty small maybe we'll have some time to adjust/get used to things what's a good email collincburton@gmailcom fun where are you now coming up on omaha still another 25 hours on this flight good to know thanks for leith me know- my dad's not that open about talking about health issues or the passing of his family tell me about it i didn't find out the real reason my mom died until a couple of years ago when i contacted the coroner and got their report whats your number 801 6363261 if the rest doesn't work you need to get it checked will do nice good to know thanks for the heads up i'm gonna talk to benj in an hour benj was no that was funny i like the guy (there are black people in utah) so watch this again and watch for the guy in the green shirt with the plant (0:17) he's trying to hide because he moved the plant from the backdrop hahaha you have seen half of the black people at byu didn't you know there's always a guy lying down in the library entrance next to a plant it's a common place to take a nap ok awesome i will likely be in south bay tmrw evening but my housemates can let you in if you advise on when you'll show up i'll also be leaving work around 1:30p wed and have meetings 10a-1p any chance you could swing by for breakfast the 14th so breakfast on the 14th instead of coffee at 2 it might be possible my friend said she will decide in a week if she will take ur house or not ok we still aren't sure if it will be available but i'll keep you posted date of death july 1 1995 anything else yeah - i need to write your thingssorry you read my mind i'm still about 6 responses short and the deadline is fast approaching hmm ok i just sent her a note can you double check have you tried looking in your spam folder yep good old spam filter got it i always forget to check there haha well i decided to focus on getting into my residency right now i have an interview at stanford ucla usc ucsd my backup is utah all good options i have to pass my licensing exam next month or i'm toast though my goal is to end up at stanford where i can mingle with great biotech people and find partners good luck i'm sure you'll do great sorry i could nt call we dont know why we are going up there we felt prompted to sell our home so we did it took 9 months to do so we were looking in az for a home but nothing felt right we went to the temple and the lord told us to move to utah i was worried because i didnt have a job or anything lined up in utah i told my boss that i was leaving (not an easy thing with him is very much not religious) and he immediately asked if i would consider to telecommute and keep my position huge blessing so we have know idea where we are moving to in utah but he has taken care of us thus far you and your wife have more cojones than i do right right i still dont know how you feel about the situation with your brother but that's ok you can tell share with me whatever you feel like he's probably more on the genetic side same thoughts from my hs friend (also lds) the first time we went to squatters (and then last year at fiddlers) he said his eyes had been opened it was "the entrance to hell" as his parents had taught him lol though i did caution him - it's all about the company you keep :d i think i am pretty good company yeah we had a special conversation at the mba orientation about how it's ok to go to bars with coworkers being unsocial is one of the biggest critiques of byu business students yeah i am in san diego for good now so i will definitely be here for thanksgiving and christmas just drop me a line when you get in i'll be home for the next two weeks i'll give you a call and we'll go and do something yes my flight lands on monday night and my interview is on tuesday you are welcome to stay at my place i'm only about 15-20 minutes from huntsman and 30 minutes from the airport i also have a guest room let me know ahead of time if you want to stay here there's a few things i'll need to get in order first so i have the encrypted file on google drive and the app can find it there that's one way lastpass is the only one i know that automatically syncs shop around they all usually have free trials find one that works for you hey collin how are you sorry looks like haven't been on messenger all summer and i logged in a week ago to see all these messages i would have known about nick leaving from here rather than being shocked when i read his email days later 😀 haha that is not reasonable how was your race it was great i met up with some really fast guys and kept up with them for probably 10 miles or so i didn't know i could ride that fast what email do you use for paypal collincburton@gmailcom got it thanks sounds like fun: a desk a product and that's it do you know if they pay yes but it won't be at the final pay amount when full time that’s all saw this at brickyard a few weeks back you may want to fix it if you haven't already pood baking apples so incredibly crazy but park at a hotel and take the metro to the mall it's pretty cool dont expect to park anywhere near the mall on the 4th :-) how's life out there woohoo when for what first week of june for disneyland we are going to take a day off during the week as well to have a bit of change of pace it would be great to meet up that day for a bit if we can haha she blew me off i've been on the waitlist for this thing for months i finally got added today it looks like it could be pretty useful what were the results of the graduation trip survey you put out haha i am but yes i think there are at least 2 others still open as well one might have just gotten filled i made alec send that out haha even wrote it for him yeah sonya announced in a melanoma meeting that she just filled the position will do i don't know if youv'e noticed but on any 360 content on the facebook app you should now see a view in vr button on your feed tap it and it will instruct you to put the phone in the helmet i've shared a few items on my wall you might like to ceck out this video is pretty good: https://wwwfacebookcom/countdownvr/videos/1156344211064233/ i forgot about that one i've been meaning to watch it it was way good definitely gave me the feels this is such a big step up from cardboard haha it's mixed i just finished a paper on the nba and i'm starting this one on career transitions (hence retirement) i like the weather (finally) - it's been really rainy til recently dan yanez and maya are visiting this sunday so that's exciting phd programs are just tough it's been a tough first year hey so this is out of left field but my dad is thinking about a career transition i don't know a ton about what he's done in the past but i know he's been a programmer a systems analyst and an it guy and he's doing more with big data and tableau now does that overlap with data science at all and would someone with that background make sense there here is my friend's email her name is christine petrone cmpetrone@comcastnet man i miss money true paychecks are nice btw i hope my "political" post doesn't irritate you too much i enjoy listening to and reading everyone's views i only recently started to voice my concerns 🙏🙏🙏 varying points of views are more than welcome as long as the discussion stays civil it's fine thanks collini sent the info and i posted it let me know if you get any takers this comic pretty much sums up the phd path https://upmicfileswordpresscom/2015/02/passionate-about-sciencepng thought you might appreciate this cool talked to recruiter shoot me a resume and i'll put you in the system doesn't guarantee anything but should give you a boost thanks i'm working on a custom resume i'll have it to you by the end of the week or sooner i know my daughters are free to go to church if they want but they choose not to because they feel like they are somehow "bad" because they don't have the perfect family everyone else does my older daughter regularly attends the methodist church instead - no guilt last time i talked to the youth about family history i got "talked to" because i told some stories that painted people as "normal" -rather than as someone they should be worshipingthe spresident didn't like that yeah it can be that way sometimes especially in utah my home ward in california was a little less judgemental since practically everyone was a convert and came from some sort of broken home it's clear you have to at sign up any luck with the biogen idec contact 3d printing is interesting because it could totally disrupt supply chains think- automotive you wouldn't need the machine to mold it ship it inventory it you just have the file and print on demand there's still a lot of price hurdles and ease of use concerns can any of them print metal yet i take it you're not attending the inauguration not even sure i'll watch it ive heard of it cool looks like a fun place to work hm no idea if you are in the area i can just give you the tour though that would be great i'll let you know more details as i get a few more things figured out is that offer for a tour and your couch still available maybe thursday i could do williams on thursday i have meetings from 11-12 & 1-2 i had to park at the marriott center so running 5 min late collin missed a call from you am i meeting you at the tanner building just parking walking in now haha ik in all seriousness though any of those cities would be fantastic places but i'd probably choose socal over the others since i'm familiar with it so once you have the files you'll need to put them into the 360videos folder inside the oculus folder that should allready be on the phone if you don't have a 360videos folder in your oculus folder yet go ahead and make one ok he is adorable can i share pics of him too sure would be great to get more of the gang in the bay can you do me a small favor i'm working on a case competition regarding composting / recycling for the bay area it would really help me if you could snap a quick picture with your phone of all the different waste containers at the facebook cafeteria i remember there being quite a few options i have a team mate from china and another from mexico and i want them to see what trash collection looks like around here they are flying me out at the end of the month passed 2 phone interviews so far to seattle k- we moved to out the back of the lobby to the firepit which sheraton are you in casey missed a call from you is it bay tower to the north or the bigger one to the east i'll take your extra star wars ticket if it's still available it's all yours ummhell no hello from 35000 feet are you there nothing in particular i know we haven't spoken in a while (2 years according to the date stamp in this window) i am horrible at keeping in touch with people it definitely gets harder as time passes are you still in chicago happy to help the rest is up to you (no pressure) :-) congrats on passing the phone interview sweet i didn't know yet so thank you for the good news the last time i spoke to the recruiter i think she said i was going to fly out on monday if i passed the phone interview okay friday would probably be best i have no classes that day so we can go whenever is good for you ok let's meet at noon then you got any favorites for where to go go for it maybe around one i'd call first haha will do you should not have liked or commented now you have to pick from one of these below and post it to your status this is the 2014breast cancer awareness game don't be a spoil sport pick your poison from one of these and change your status 1) damn diarrhea 2) just used my boobs to get out of a speeding ticket 3) how do you get rid of foot fungus 4) no toilet paper goodbye socks 5) i think i'm in love with someone what should i do 6) i've decided to stop wearing underwear 7) it's confirmed i'm going to be a mommy/daddy 😎 just won $900 on a scratch card 9) i've just found out i've been cheated on the past 5 months post with no explanations so sorry i fell for it too looking forward to your post oh boy we're actually going to elope to the vegas temple or you could do like they did right before i came go to vegas for a quickie civil wedding sleep with each other then get it annulled the next day that way you're still temple worthy cool supply chain has a really good reputation and places really well here are three companies that are healthcare related that byu mbas have been placed at in the last year or so: ensign group texas health resources or ecg management consultants are you interning at the black diamond in holladay that's about a block away from where i live let's do it i'm down in cruces but we have communities up there do you ever make it up to farmington that's where my in-laws live good to hear should be a fun summer it reminds me a lot of the bay area just smaller and without as many people there's also more things to eat besides asian food it's interesting how analytical my role has been here i've done virtually no finance wow what have you been doing nope he's in the middle east where it's been my bday for hours hey man what was your comment on that post i couldn't read the whole thing "we'll at least you have your height going for you" i was getting back at you for that "really really good father" dig the other day :-) keepass is free and open source that's what drew me to it free is nice i bet flight going well i can't get the google one to work up here what are you up to around here got some pt for an old ankle injury i'm here want to split a room at nbmbaa again i don't have a ton of time but i would like to get through a bunch of this material i could probably find 2 hours a day the course page should tell you how many hours per week as well i think you should definitely do the class it really set me apart in the mba program as being a legit analytics/data science guy bay area companies actually recognize it on resumes as well i had a recruiter from equinix tell me that if i had put that on there he would have interviewed me right away when do you start at facebook oops it's another girl named lauren it's hard enough for me to learn first names let alone last ones this is collin from myriad i'm the one who keeps sending out the emails about ragnar great one last thing how long should i plan on taking to present and is there anything you want me to focus on specifically for your meeting oh dang haha alright i will definitely keep it going strong thanks collin how's the knee going that might work really well actually where does he live layton good luck and it's a gorgeous drive i love the midwest where did you stay in chicago oh so working in orem probably wouldn't work he's interested he said he can take front runner down he'll send you a resume he's very interested and said he saw your ad on ksl not that i know of ok i'll see if i can remember to drop a check off with someone can the eventbrite go straight to the checking account i have set up for the reunion already it should be able to i'll check more into it i honestly think that's the best way to spend your time if you want to move up in the world i think it's actually more valuable than the master's degree since it get's you face time if you don't get in the door there's not much of a chance do be where you want to be or go where you want to go if you want a good networking group for our industry i'd check out the bench to bedside competition i've gone to some pretty cool events from them utc has some good stuff too okay then i'll have to contact the prof anyway thanks colin sorry for the typo collin have a great night i was just looking for jonathan on facebook but it looks like his account was deleted is everything okay map yep my application was submitted in november any word from your tas awe- thanks collin 󾌬 anybody know what grandma t's middle name is for all their size and whatnot i found the florida disney parks to be really lacking compared to california universal is the way to go definitely i think they close ealry now too sure thanks for thinking of me what does the nomination process call for do i need to provide a bio of what i've been doing since high school i have my firm bio but that's pretty short it's pretty short they are looking for info on what you did in high school which i think i can cover well enough what puts you in the top of your field any volunteer work you've done and how you could be a good role model for high school kids here's the form if you are interested https://sitesgooglecom/a/guhsdnet/mvhs-alumni/nomination-form i need an email address for you as well so they can let you know if you won yeah looked suncrest as well nice area i am not sure i would go south of lindon though yes especially since they are planning on moving north sometime in the future just trying to catch up with my facebook - a once in every few decades event congratulation love the way you are announcing the newest arrival to be the throw away diapers are the only way to go when more than one using them look forward to seeing you in july - thanks should have been yo lol see you tomorrow ok i'm around for a bit i thought you were just seeing if i needed to use the bathroom getting my hopes up i just messaged our marketing team i'll let you know what i

reception invite for thursday and i have a lunch thing with wells fargo (i already have an offer from wells) but thats it cool i haven't heard of anyone with an offer yet it could be worth asking shawna gygi or someone about it or if you know of any 2nd years that are looking do you have to be onsite for 20 hours a week oh awesome i am going to swing down there to pick up a package- so i will look for you to say hi cool i'm in lucas right now did i miss you yet ok good hope you might make it also ;-) i should be able to make it absolutely it is coralazarian@gmailcom hey cori what time is the pro sem at this friday anything i should see in/around that area cedar point awesome roller coasters sorry i meant i got a say is that what you switched into then this is a little bit dated but still good info i'm not a fan of ancestrydna because they don't provide any kind of "proof" for what they are doing they rely on unsourced unsubstantiaed trees to create their cute little dna circle things - not good research or science to rely on things that are that wrong good to know thanks for sending the paper maybe you'll get a lead from it did you see about the company that just launched a genetic panel test for $250 hey we're you the one that posted about unique sport headphones what was the name they sell them a few different places online so you might look around a bit for the best price whats the difference between the two positions adobe would be enterprise marketing so web analytics and stuff like that fiber fix would be entrepreneurial and more general management across languages yes variety is best but you should focus on music written for your type of voice if you are lirico ligero lirico spinto or just lirico you choose music written for that type of voice listen to juan diego flores and then listen to placido domingo you'll hear the difference and yet both are tenors-just different voice types that's why they sing different repetoire got it amzn cool cooli want it :-) ok can you do paypal dang i have a new schedule where i work four days on four days off and i need a hobby i'm always partial to running really same time yep i'm surprised mom didn't tell

we could tell he really enjoyed it my thing here is i normally work from home 3x/week if i need to go to a meeting or whatever i just go and come back when i can so with my personal startups that is

i got it from a colon cancer survivor so i felt a bit obligated yay what date we'll be in sd from the 8th to the 13th and at disneyland from the 3rd to the 8th yes netflix runs a speed test each time

yet what's your current recommendation on netbooks damn you collin i'll do it for breast cancer did you used to live in san diego thats nuts are you working for that pharm company like you wanted we

tell them how likely they are to get cancer brb i actually felt a little sick after the roller coaster so hopefully i can get some information to you mid-late week and about your visitjust let me know good luck hey- just wanted to clarifydid you still need my genentech contact i think you might have connected with someone already is this correct i have a good gtech contact for a tour but i'd still like to connect with as many people there as i can to build a network no what's that it's a place that sells kolache's between dallas and waco https://googl/maps/xhkpgmfksjk2 they are pretty tasty i have gmail what address ditto thought you were going skiing how is liam we might go after lunch liam is fine but milo woke up covered in diarrhea yes it's very nice except for getting me allergy recently i just saw this think in austin looks pretty awesome http://wwwwavegardencom/ ok i'll email them today are you ok if drew brown joins our team sure aaron is in china until sat night maybe sat night or sunday i can ask him when i talk to him next that would be great thanks for the help tell aaron to keep his lungs clean in china dad said that your planning to do it in april i'm very seriously considering being on your team if you'll have me i'm going to start training today i'm concerned that i might not be in good enough shape though so i wanted do a few weeks of training before i said anything to you i don't typically run hills so i have no idea how a hill will affect my running time also i've never ran more that 5 miles at a time (and that was a long time ago) right now i run about 3 miles 3x/wk on a treadmill my time is 10min/mi (no incline) but i think i might be able to push myself a little and get a better time or at least the same time on an incline we'll see your thoughts i don't want to slow your team down so if after a couple weeks i can't seem to improve maybe this year isn't the year for me to compete i did just have a baby but i really want to i'd like to run it but i don't want to captain the team if i don't have to i already have the two teams at work that i'm doing and i don't know if i can bring another team together as far as your abilities you'll be fine 10 min/mile is how fast i usually run on my training runs speed isn't a factor in this anyway as long as your team's average pace is better than the required 12 min/mile you're fine you have two more months to train which is plenty of time to get in shape you can pick your route as well so you can choose something that isn't too intimidating some portions are easier than others oh no worries thanks- i will have fun on your trip how exciting i'm finally getting around to this i'll send you an invite to the info i have on ancestrycom i'll send the invite to caseytruax@yahoocom if you are looking for baby names i have some other tools that can make a word cloud based on your ancestors names also i don't have any info on the thompson line your uncle lucky has most of that lol why has it been a rough night kid puke sweet thanks i just got a suspicious email from you it looks like it's from turboscan it has an attachement that looks like an amazon fulfillment test form and your bar admission certificate sorry collin if garman doesn't get it and i don't get it it's probably not movie based i was also thinking wwe/john cenna esque but garman would have caught that sort of thing too so we're stumped i bit the bullet and asked on the original post maybe it's some kind of inside joke i'll let you know if i hear anything i can't say that i know that is in the works but it is that would be awesome not much traffic and no blind curves at the hospital what movie 40 year old virgin i will i come most years carmella@bonaireproductionscom done happy late birthday yay nobody tells me anything good thing i have fbi and a brother who lives a few states away to keep me in the loop fb not fbi though it kinda feels like the same thing it's good for stalking people i think i told you already but i'm heading back to byu in the fall just want to make sure you know hey hi yes i did :) i love that picture of your family i sent it out to over 200 people only 3 went to my site

with the idea crushed it thank you sir 5 minutes what are you up to in sugarhouse i'm looking for a couch i'm visiting my family my original plan was to come in may after graduating but it was too complicated to do it right before the move to england and also it was a mess visa-wise so i made a last-minute decision to come now at the expense of skipping class for 2 weeks this semester :( it was

just put you are cordially invited to "a decade of change" if you offer a $5 discount for a couple of days as well you'll get a lot more people quickly it puts some pressure on them to stop procrastinating i think that would work fine i want to reply to your post on the puzzle "this maze requires a lot of concentration to solve" but sister harris wouldn't find that funny at all that made me laugh you can solve it if you always turn reich lol nice it just displays as black on my phone i heard a talk today from the guy that made haveibeenpwndcom he showed us this website thanks collin we would love to go but we have stuff on sunday that we have to be here for hope you have a great time sounds good how's the summer going ya teaching yoga and living on my farm that's not really a farm but wants to be you pretty standard suburban life 3 boys still in utah ok maybe we'll be living close by and can surf together what would you rank the following cities in terms of livability: dallas houston stanford la san diego slc and charleston i need to come up with a rank list that decides where i match if you go to stanford your house won't be as nice or you'll have a long commute personally i'd put dallas and houston lower on the list it's hot and muggy and there isn't much to do as someone with kids dallas could be nice because the houses are cheap but that's not your situation not sure yet was planning on figuring it out tomorrow when i get there this week hasn't given me much time to look into it unfortunately you probably go between tech and marketing nighty night thinking of coming down tomorrow anytime after 2 right i just remembered you work near research park right if so we should ride to work some morning when it heats up does not seem likely i'll still be in full swing with the last day of the fest up here leaving sunday then mom flies in to dallas on monday ok just thought i'd check i still haven't gone on one roller coaster i might come back in 2 weeks without kids that time hmm well here's how i think about things i think sexuality exists on scale90-100 is purely hetero 0-10 is purely homo 50 is purely bisexualthere are very few people at the extremes or exactly in the middle and more people in the middle but because of cultural norms people who are say a 35 end up being heterosexual or 75 end up being homosexual so as this relates to choices i think people end up make choices and decisions based on where they fall on the sclae there are probably more people in the 40-60 range who could properly be called bisexual but society really frowns on that so people are forced to choosebecause of that the michael urie thing isn't super suprising to me interesting i wouldn't have put you in the homosexuality as a choice camp you're welcome friend i expect a place to stay when i come through san diego someday --nm dude what do you have against the bible don't you love this new facebook news feed apparently i am not running it anymore there is a crack whore lady who is getting evicted and another who says the apts smell like meth i bet the baked lady came out of the apt section on the east end that's the alleged crack whore

business hey kendal where are you at now hi collin i apologize for the random nature of this message i realize i feel like i have gotten to know you over facebook even though i rarely get the chance

grandparents were divorced back in 1969 i'm a little confused did i lose you sorry i got a phone call that's a strange record to find my alumni contract at ag asked out through the ward for us we found a student family who were leaving for the summer so we will be in their house where in ohio would you be contact* akron we have been thinking about going to cleveland instead since it's a cooler place and only 30 minutes from akron you live over here i used to live here before mba school yep we are renting a house up here for super cheap it made more sense to commute down where did you used to live that would be awesome is only pluralsight pms no it's open to the community but we host it i would publicize for you but college is a terrible place to publicize fundraisers but i can still spread the word there's a few people on our team that can raise over $1000 with just a single email thanks for the help i know college students don't have much money but there a lot of them

interested in hosting it in their auditorium mhm http://enwikipediaorg/wiki/camp_(style) your brother is not main stream gay and it will remain to be seen whether that is temporary or permanent i mean maybe he hasn't had the opportunity to venture out and if he's living in a small town in michigan that makes sense and when he was living in san diego im guessing he wasn't hanging out in hillcrest

database to big pharma 23andme is basically doing very big gwas studies - not linking anything to pedigrees ancestry is trying/would like to link their snp data to pedigrees and family health histories - kind of like the utah population database - only with snp data yeah i figures they would have a much more compelling product but i didn't know if they were collecting the right snps i might have an opportunity to work with their dna group next year me too too bad i'm still trying to figure out who got it it wasn't me or nathaniel ah ok akron doesn't have much to do this is what i

minute ahhhh it is 75 because the ee go with the dominantright now you got it another way to look at it is since 25% have attached earlobes then 75% must have attached that's why i said i thought you

of things are the layoffs just in your office or across the company across the company i could see the whole department going in all honesty off the rack suits which fit most "normal" bodies are $150 his custom ones start at $400 he also has nice dress shirts and ties i'll get in touch then those are competitive prices i haven't decided yet but it won't be an apple pie ;) did he tell you about

analysis very common usage in the industry yep that's what i used was it called recommenderlab hey sorry i wasn't able to setup a call a lot of unexpected stuff came up and i just finished doing it ok i'm worried that we won't be able to get something of quality done in time i've watched too many take the 23andme test and think they are in the clear though it is more complex than one mutation = breast cancer 23 and me is just a point mutations this new looks like it's a sequencing based test haha thanks for sharing good luck on first week thanks for sending that article pwc looks like they

offer and now working in seattle yeah they took 3 one from stanford one from mit and i can't remember where the 3rd one is from only a few in my class even thought about ps can i do a 7 day free trial

be the most helpful i can get someone else if you want jorge brock burrows etc with you i'd rather pick someone who's going to present well since you're good in data mining we can get steeve mineer or dalan or i can even ask nicola kelly seymour is quite good too imo kelly is going to be really good in presentations brock will be a good speaker jorge and steve will be good in data mining and overall presentation tho drew has a pretty good experience in data mining just be sure not to take too many data scientists i'm in a meeting but i'll respond in a little bit don't want you to think

has been such a good change hi collin as you know about a year ago we made a decision to invest heavily into real estate one of the most shocking strategies we learned was how to pay our house off in 6 months which we've chatted a bit about before i would love to share it with you have you ever wanted to invest in real estate if you have i would love to show you our most recent property that we will net over $65000 on in less than 2 months this saturday we will be hosting a house tour to teach others how you can do it too let me know happy birthday ryan i hope your summer is going well haha that's pretty cool it looks like it would take a while to test out of the different subjects i know there's 3 tests that will let you skip half of the program i can't pass the third one probably are you two going to come on saturday thx definitely talk to him about it speaker training/coaching is part of the deal i mentioned it to him again tonight he's a bit busy with a startup if he won't do it i'll pitch the topic yeah did you what a cool company yeah i thought i saw your resume on the desk there hey collin sorry i had to switch to my computer my phone was dying no problem analyzing the impact of that $5b it's trade spend analysis cool these guys didn't give me a project for the first few weeks so i decided to create a product recommender like amazon's so you would want to complete the mba yes ok cool good to know thanks the survey pool tends to be younger and more male than the general population information puke done we doing whole families or just bros my wife has been on the phone for the last 30 min so i haven't been able to run it past her but yes i think saturday will work do you take venmo for the scout flags we really love it are family is so much more active now sounds good glad you're enjoying it let me know if you ever need anything i'll be in michigan the last week of july to the first week of august might tack it onto one side or the other of that sounds like a plan collin i think 10-15 minutes would be great and focus on items that hhh athletes could put into action as well as our staff-- e-mail templates (if you don't have a person you are running for use this) etc that'd be great ok that's what i'll plan for there's a whole pile of running group fliers here might be a good place to put some hhh stuff right was it what you expected better worse about what i expected who are you we went on the philmont horse trip together back in the day i think that was you anyway (y) update on the facebook referral i got an email from anne foor today she was just asking for a resume i'll let you know if anything else happens it looks like the byu mba crew is coming to facebook in january i'm not sure what the exact day is but i'll be stopping by sometime between january 14 - 16 when are you coming out to visit jenny & i wife and i have talked about boston this summer but that's as close as i'm coming so far it would be fun to go to dc too absolutely i had cardboard on my iphone it was cool but i never used it for any length of time too nauseating i always saw the white line in the middle the content was nowhere near equivalent to the gear either i guess that is more of occulus than gear gotcha wwwpluralsightcom do they pay well (they have two potential positions in "content" kinda my thing ;-) ) their goal is to be at or above market in pay everyone gets stock when they sign up lots of opportunities for incentive pay big muscular russian guy just came to my office and asked me on a date met him this morning when i ran an errand to his office simultaneously dazzled and wary i think you would like this place they can make women's clothes custom to your size and modesty preferences i know how hard it is to find stuff in your small size http://wwweshakticom i just saw someone come out of the apartments in nothing but their underwear what kind of place are you guys running over there i'm actually sitting at hq right now interesting line up of people what are you doing there nice you dont think i would get good tips eh almost makes me want to ditch my morals and prove you wrong hahaha can you send me your friend's email his facebook is set to not accept messages from non-friends hehehehe i don't know if anything can compare to the video that collin emailed mom recently karen already has enough embarrassing video of me over 2 hours worth ps i start school on thursday only 6 more years to go woohoo i'm thinking about genetics or molecular biology i'm interested in working with nucleic acids where else did you apply how much lab experience did you have when you have when you applied how much did other applicants have thanks for your time answering my questions we already have plans unfortunately i hope you guys have a great time at the pageant sounds like a great experience sounds good aren't you almost done with your internship now this sounds like it would be a great fit for you then i worked at ancestrycom before coming back to byu so if you have questions about the company i'd be happy to answer them or i also know a few people there i don't know how it will work with the "no working during your first year" policy but maybe there's a way to work something out if i can get it like your role it's got its plusses and minuses i found out that there is another bigger analytics group besides ours with the new ceo we have i'm not sure he'll want two separate groups that would be a blast i think i might try to put a small group together let me know if you need another person wheres fiberfix/ which job would you be most interested in fiber fix is in orem and i think it would be the most interesting do you know my reddit username no woohoo my dad is here too we almost went to

ragnar people sorry for the delay thanks for the carfax all is well i should be doing that ahha im just trying to get out of here to st gearge so i wasnt thinking about anything else but what a great example for me now i am going to do better in the future@ thankyou friend looks like i need to qualify the last dna thing i said to you the tests still shouldn't be very different for what your sister said but cells have their own unique copy of dna that may be substantially different i could see that or maybe just put up the first chapter of a complete training deck just enough so they can see your quality but have to talk to you to get the rest it's probably not the idea you were thinking of but i think it would be more worthwhile 10 my 7 year old like to play the math and word games he's not that in to drawing cool i think we might get one for my kid's 7 year birthday thanks for the review how's life at myriad going yes we got one for caitlyn she loves it it is so cool and fun how old

couple of zeroes the first year only the possibilities down south what time would you be around pretty good it's a fun company to work for because they are going through a lot of change how about you it's ok i'll probably keep looking for other opportunities my project is doing exactly what we did with the abc inventory planning what kind of big changes is monsanto going through i just realized yesterday that sunday is fast sunday and there will likely be a break the fast for my ward if they have one you should go i'll see if i can stop by visit the back2school center at http://wwwfacebookcom/back2schoolphp to see my prediction for you in the upcoming school year and to make predictions of your own about your friends on facebook i'm the same what are the other byu mbas making varies by the company the highest i've heard is 8k a month at exxonmobil for comparison equinix offered me $25/hour we are doing suncrest twice before ogden that's a good one i struggled with an injury and knee issues for weeks and finally took my own advise and took my running in the pool i already after two week get up from sitting without pain if i had an event i would have never let it get this far rest will take care of most things not all so if it still hurts after get it checked is everything ok yeah karen called when we stopped in draper liam had throw up in his crib and since karen is already nauseous she wanted to see if i was nearby to clean it up we had some communication issues and i thought she wanted me to come home turns out the fastest way home from draper is riding i ended up meeting the group again but i was riding a lot faster this is going to be a great weekend to go up to ride check out the canyons carpool club to share a ride or find one i thought your brother andy would really like this it's a collaborative art tribute to johnny cash i remember how much he liked him back in high school i don't have his contact info so i thought you could forward it on to him http://wwwthejohnnycashprojectcom/ auto-generated message: lacey gimpel houseman has left this conversation and will no longer see your messages i'm heading up in a bit just talking to my wife first not sure where i'm going yet but i'm going to have an adventure lol only 145 i round up 😄 thats good news i was driving today and i saw that you left out the mile marker and water stop at parley's and parkway i just realized that i probably should have grabbed it i'll see if i can swing by there tomorrow and pick it up are you running with us on saturday i'm planning on it my knee acted up a little on tuesday i was only able to run about a mile and a half i'll see how it goes today watson yeah dhruv organized the team but turns out he's taking 20 credits and only has a few hours open on friday to meet so how is the running i ran 2 miles tonight my knee hurt a little i noticed it more so when i went up the few stairs into my apartment 2 miles is probably my limit right now i'll see on monday if i can do 2 miles pain free i'm icing my knee right now and i'll stretch when the ice is done thanks for asking me about the running i almost didn't go tonight but your message got me out there me and another byu mba intern will see you then cool who else is coming oh that's okayno worries we're only like 10 min away from daybreakso just give us like a 20 min heads up and we can head out it takes us 30 minutes to get there so we'll let you know when we head out haha did you try adobe i guess they pay better i need to look more into it i'm starting to think analytics is not so lucrative after all tierra84@gmailcom do you have vicki's and tierra's as well no problem coffee would be great beans and brews on 33rd what time yup trying to tie up all loose ends but it is going well don't know if you have been to cedar point yet but they are having a sale today of $32 off per ticket oh that would be way fun we can meet you for sure what time we could meet at that same place i met you guys for your pictures the soonest we could get out there would probably be 4:30 but we run on "little kid time" so it's a bit up in the air you can also take it to them they actually live in millcreek is that close to you if not i'll find a way to get it to them :) i live in holladay it's right next to millcreek i'm right next to olympus high school hey collin - you up for shooting saturday morning thanks for the invite but i'll have to pass i'll be gone most if thursday and all of friday and then my plane back from google doesn't land until 1am no worries man - lots of projects here to keep me busy haha what did he speak on alba vanderbilt i may be hounding you very soon as soon as i get packed :-) thank you colin how's the first day up late again hopefully not from pukin' babay it's 4 year old puke but yeah up late i didn't know there were two so will have to check that out we would mostly go for food i think but i suppose kid friendly stuff is always good how old are your kids again (i have two - my main one is not the one i'd like to use because i want it to remain totally anonymous just checking to see if i somehow let that one slip) anywau my "public" one i haven't used in years but it does have enough karma so sure awesome my nephew got married recently and his color scheme was the exact same one from nacho libre i want to nacho in the middle of the wedding picture pretty basic i bet its frigid out here :-( yeah i heard the east was getting a nice storm now hmm looks like it hey collin you must have mentioned this before but what was the meeting with shane hansen like it was pretty relaxed he just asked if i had any questions and told me about his vision for the group the way many use them is to just track their typical daily activity to feel accomplished and active without dedicated exercise a pedometer would be useful for cross country runs but i do all my running at the gym i can count laps i've wanted one with gps so i can run without the phone the phones are getting so big now that they are harder to run with things are okay how are you heard the last ragnar race was a success it went well we set a new record for fundraising $18k i'm writing because i'm in the mba program at byu and i'm looking for an internship preferably in the bay area i was wondering if you have any contacts in any of the large biotech/pharma companies out there that you wouldn't mind introducing me to i'm particularly interested in genentech i understand if you aren't willing to i'm just trying to go through as many possibilities as i can awesome i can definitely refer you though it won't mean much since i haven't worked directly with you - ironically i am the referrals analyst so i know a lot about this ha ha what position(s) are you interested in since it's so competitive to get hired at google you'll likely need to meet all the minimum qualifications and most (if not all) of the preferred qualifications this is the one that seems like the best fit initially https://wwwgooglecom/about/careers/search#t=jo&jid=21965002& it would be great if i had worked with someone that works at google but i can't currently think of anyone that currently works there i do have a current classmate in my mba program that interned at google this summer but i don't know if he's allowed to give referrals or not before i forget thank you for your help hey collin how are you quick question did you take razor's edge last semester si it was a great class do you need a book here you go good luck if you want someone to go to the void with let me know ohh great not yet; it's a 2nd-block class just wanted to ask you about the trip for the class is it mandatory also in your opinion is the class content good as well or is it just the trip the highlight for the class (poorly written question :p let me know if it's clear enough) i think i get the gist of your question i believe the trip is mandatory but it's worth asking the teacher the rest of the class is pretty good you don't meet all that often i figured as muchbut you never know about space limitations wanted to make sure awesome one of your friends already says he's coming haha thats a long list i'm hopeful it's a three bedroom three bathroom house for 800 a month just saw it its like an america's funniest home videos moment yeah we had a nice talk really good so far they threw me into the deep end first day had a meeting with our ceo chro and executive team from fortune magazine it was exciting to say the least that sounds awesome here's a muscular guy with a birthday cake for you i got bored writing a paper and just browsed through the lds people in san diego i'm at byu and have about 2 more semesters to go can't wait to be finished i love how you get your kids out doing adventurous stuff it looks like they have a great time doing it sorry collin - haha this 2nd part was meant for my nephew chris who is in munich right now thanks for the heads up rick i didn't know about the sign up page i emailed my team with the link so hopefully some of them will show up i just realized you may want to send notification to human resources at arup as well - i'm sure we could also post it at various places around arup - that would get the word out to even more people why didn't i think of that i actually have a contact in the hr department i'll keep that in mind for our next go around thanks i know a brain when i see one where you still intereseted in selling your phone let me know i can send you the money tomorrow yeah just so you know it's not the new 4g version also would you mind kicking in $5 for shipping you're welcome :) do you have our family tree yes but i'm currently traveling if i don't get it to you in a couple days remind me again depends some companies provide housing a stipend or nothing it varies from company to company do you know which track you are thinking of studying and what kind of internship you might be looking for i can provide better insight if you have an idea of what you are looking for i'm thinking supply chain right now i'd probably look for something biotech or health care related thanks for your help and time i have friday 11/11 and thurs & fri 11/24 and 11/25 off we definately need to do something and i need to return your chalk bag let me know when you're going to be down i get off of school on the 22 that means we could do the 25th the day after thanksgiving i don't know what to do though any ideas moving to next round did you have another round too he asked me to block 2 hours any idea what would this be about i don't know i went through the phone call and on site but that was it how many people did you talk with during the last visit ben said he was going back as well i thought your brother andy would really like this it's a collaborative art tribute to johnny cash i remember how much he liked him back in high school i don't have his contact info so i thought you could forward it on to him http://wwwthejohnnycashprojectcom/ you got a large envelope from someone named olsen here that you should probably pick up hey sorry for not getting back to you i don't need the card but if you want to throw it in ill take it do you want me to get a money order and send it to you paypal would be faster and cheaper but money order is ok too i will no worries maybe there will be some availability shortly thanks i'm sorry collin i've been trying to book uber but was told there is no any availability now i'm not sure when there'll be availablility i just looked at another app called lyft it looks like uber and lyft have been banned from picking people up from the airport you won't he able to get an uber ride from there it was good nice view glad im done and cant wait to shower bobi jo to start in 20 min or soyour last run looks hard hey selena how are things he's awesome he was going to be my manager there at the end i decided to take the risk on the product side but boy i was impressed with pluralsight send alejandro my regards if you see him will do i'd love to connect with the chief data officer but i don't know how safe is to connect with him i mean he may interview me on monday i have no clue but it wouldn't be surprisiing i can ask him if you want utah is cold how about charleston vs san diego i have some classmates that did their internship in charleston some of them liked it some didn't i think it's a smaller town with less to do probably not as many single mormons out there san diego has lots of mormons we are in cincinnati it has rained nearly every day out here what's your weather been like lots of rain it's finally starting to feel like summer the travel doc now has all of the links for discounted tickets for disney world there are black out dates with these tickets so make sure it works with your travel plans bree thats enough in itself you have 4 beautiful kids and thats a lot oto handle yeah i'm having a hard enough time with 2 and you're helping from out of state which is difficult too so my dad is the president of the america 's for them well that's quite the connection hey if it's going to sit there i'll take it i can venmo whatever shipping costs where do you want me to send it collin see you tomorrow morning thanks a lot no problem ☺ totally i don't get back from texas until the 22nd or so of sep so it will have to be late in the month what are the best times to go can we take the dog time to start doing some research that can work wow thats awesome its exciting to be a part of each others lives as we engage in this career changing process yeah lots of cool people all around hey jonathan we are heading to the hill cumorrah pagent on saturday i'm inviting anyone in the area to go it would be great to have a group of byu mba students there we were riding home how did you do great my speed average went up and it was a great day auto-generated message: kerry-ann williams has left this conversation and will no longer see your messages auto-generated message: collin burton has left this conversation and will no longer see your messages roallercoaster some days good some days not so good but i like the role it's great do you know the pms in pluralsight i'd love to connect to them get to know them i haven't met any yet actually i think they do a meetup here on product stuff every once in a while i'll let you know if i hear of a new one oh great collin how is adjusting to two kids its all about extra sensors to decrease lag thats the major difference for me i've also got a process for ripping 360 videos from youtube and viewing them in the gear i'm really hoping youtube gets around to doing a gearvr app though in the meantime do you have a dropbox yeah i just bought independence day for $5 it's on sale congrats i think i might stop by tomorrow and ask some questions about the apm jobs are you going to be around friday probably works best for me i don't have class that day sounds good williams building at 12 most of the classes have been great one or two are ok but that could be because i did business undergrad so it was repetitive but overall they have been great really good professors how are they at providing instruction in advanced analytics looks like i'll be coming to byu this fall if it is submitted before monday morning when i print them out that will be ok i submitted three nominations i hope you like them so myself my wife kirsa and 4 kids 6-9 years old :) *5-9 yeah definitely not finca let me think there's two places i'm thinking would be good zupas or tonyburger zupas is soup salads and sandwiches tonyburger has burgers salads and some pretty good milkshakes both are kid friendly haha well i have an offsite but the other bu's are around cool thanks perfect is there anything wrong with it besides just being a older version it came with a 2 gb memory card out of the box but i was planning on keeping that do you need a charger it uses the standard micro usb that all smartphones use i've got an extra one i can throw in if you need it it's a little dusty on the inside but that can be cleaned the screen is flawless it looks like my old 2gb card is too small to keep up with the demands of my new phone i can throw the memory card in for you as well you still interested nice and are you not sure yet i need to see if i have enough time wow ya that's unexpected it was so smart that it correctly put the title "ales representative" into the salesperson group totally caught the misspelling and rod is already in idahohe looked at a job in slci could have handed you the tape i will get 2 dvds made and send you one but it might be awhile so don't think i forgot your kid's are adorable thanks for doing that great so nice to hear from you how are you and karen and the boys doing i have been busy at work which is always a good thing- turns out i'm a bit of a work-a-holic ;) i am living with casey and her boyfriend justin in sac and just plugging away day to day are the boys keeping you crazy busy boys school and work are enough to keep anyone maxed out i think the work-a-holic thing runs in the family you your dad mary lou my mom they all work super hard oh bummer how's nbmbaa going in general ok i have 3 more interviews tomorrow i wasn't able to get any new ones while i've been out here except for emc possibly it's crazy here as usual ill leave the planning to the expert and just go along for the ride let me know how far we're hiking sounds good with that many days we can do more than just the narrows what's your email i have some info i need to send your way think of a class where you'd rather be in the hall teaching yourself to write code ah yeah i forgot about mr real life hey did you know david teng when you were at biofire best teacher ever alburgue is what they call the hostels you stay at on the trip i think most people speak english along the camino if you see someone that's german they are pretty much guaranteed to speak english i'm not as familiar with off the beaten path stuff that far north the most northern one is a town called penafiel they have a pretty cool castle there and some really good food love ya aunt barb more learning i'm applying to graduate school so i can get my phd what are you going to do i sent in one of the case competition decks yes i wrote it down and will put it in a secret place so i wont forget it again what city did she die in el cajon ive thought about that - but all the trainings ive done are proprietary can you put up a sterile version no this is just to supplement my work with our strategic account reps do more large accounts and places where like that center flow is important vs a small clinic so if i went to marketing would i have to start working 10 hour days travel every month and never see my family again when you get there let me know what the culture is like i'm a rockstar here and getting tons of attention and responsibility pay is decent but the exp and flexibility are what i'm here for they have 2 teslas that they let the employees borrow free snacks cool workspace they pay for your healthcare premiums there's a golf simulator in the break room you know usual tech company perks they should correctly level the picture too :p yeah it was a shoestring budget for these two only 19 no job no car mom that's openly against the marriage good times we're great she loves her job in palo alto in fact i've thought about applying for a google job recently awesome you may know this but if you have an internal referral your resume is guaranteed to be looked at by a recruiter so apply that way if at all possible oh wow i bet it feels good to know you are making a difference would you want to work there after school now they just need to implement it i could think of worse places to work but i can think of a lot better ones too they let a lot of people work remotely so that's nice 😊 i got the bag by the way thank you you're welcome wshute@gmailcom bring a headlamp too just in case wendi you mean one of these caleb has a little one and mary lou gave me a bigger one a while ago caleb has

suspicions for a while i wasn't too surprised hi collin glad you liked the post completely understand the friends/strangers thing since i'm a congressional staffer a "watchdog" website tracks every single thing i post that's accessible to the public but -- strictly hypothetically speaking -- if i had an alterego who could be followed and who occasionally cross-posted those same things publicly that alterego would be https://wwwfacebookcom/catherinesamuelson3 perfect thanks i look forward to more reading how has the experience been with symantec would you be able to have a phone conversation

which track are you planning on doing so because p=q they are the same and they are the alleles ok so everyone has 2 alleles one you get from your dad and one you get from your mom and ask what the specific thrust of the position is mine is more implemenation communication with field strategy i might use a different word combination besides thrust and position but i get it yeah that's true i'm

one phew i was kind of hoping for not more than $300 but could go up to $500 is that even in the realm of reasonable yes i think so i've got to run for a minute be right back i can do this for $300 does that work for you yeah man doing that now it looks like our old friend dwight is going to be on tv http://wwwbravotvcom/start-ups-silicon-valley/season-1/videos/geeks-are-definitely-the-new-rock-stars i co-coached our kids' soccer team with his wife cool i'll have to mention it to him tomorrow was

in that department i find pedometers to create an artificial positive feedback loop yeah the one in my phone is pretty inaccurate i'm glad you contacted me i've been looking for a logical argument to the whole same sex marriage thing but i can't seem to find one that holds much water for either side but probably less so for the traditional marriage side i can explain why same sex marriage doesn't make sense from an lds perspective with the whole eternal families idea but you can't really use that in a secular debate sorry it took so long to respond kids suck up so much time beth i probably won't be up for organizing something a bit too much going on at the moment i'll probably still be out on my lawn that morning though hey collin sorry i have not checked fb for a while yes i grew up in

off gotcha my second round with them was after i had spent 5 hours at genentech i should have delayed it because i was really tired i bet you'll love the amazon campus i hear it's pretty awesome did you ever use octave for anything else other than this course no you need it for this class because you are going to code a linear regression and neural network from scratch it's great to understand how things work but it's pretty technical for what we will end up doing i did use it once at work to code a logistic regression with 1000+ variables r breaks down with that many variables but you can use the techniques in the class to make it work im giving several presentations to mater dei catholic freshmen do you think theres anything in there that might interest them or is it higher level stuff i think you might find something i had a non-technical coworker from sales say that troy hunt was her favorite author that would be great thanks phone is shipped thursday sounds good when do you

sounds comforting lindon is not an exciting one to work at 😜 don't hold me to it i'm mostly guessing thanks for reaching out i miss you guys in ohio hello kelly i met a byu undergrad that is looking into a few career paths including consulting i thought you would be a great info interview for her to talk to her name is mette and here is her linkedin https://wwwlinkedincom/in/mette-laurence-076709113/ can i connect you two well my closing thought is this: religion aside (if that is possible) the best thing you can do for your brother is to call

grab coffee on campus 13th i'm going to be at genentech most of the day let's do the 14th wow thinking about attending or just want to visit the campuses thinking about applying next year possibly i wanted to apply this year but i couldn't manage it while finishing my current masters degree do you have to prove you are family to get the reports or can anyone access them people mixing pain meds and alcohol is a pretty common problem i've actually seen public service announcements about the topic before i was 11 when she died i didn't know much about what was going on at that age it would be very good to know the medication now that you mention it as far as proving relation goes it probably depends a lot on the individual office but to get my mom's info all i had to do was send them an email that said i was her son no other documentation required hey i'm coming down to la soon i did a little bit of that this summer do you know any classes that teach machine learning it looks like

opera singers focus on a specific genre or are you expected to perform across languages and styles im sure you went t o school with some yes maybe nobody confirmed we can make about $50 off of them then sounds good find a buyer the religion being denied their freedom of religion are christians those pharmacist who don't want to sell the morning after abortion pill are told they must i don't understand how you say they haven't been demonized when the republican nominee wants to ban all muslims from entering the country religious persecution is when you ban an entire religion from entering your country or when a governor sends an extermination order against all mormons asking a pharmacist to provide a medicine that has been proven safe and effective hardly seems to be comparable i first agreed to be with leo and another first year than i talked to abhishek and almost got will abhi wants to participate but will said no few hours ago it is too late but having you and abhishek in a team would be even better collin i got that message from them i can email them about you if you want i don't know if you have experience in digital marketing or not thanks i'd love the referral i have a little bit of digital marketing experience colorado would be great too where do i know you from i was wondering the other day why we weren't facebook friends you never popped up until now same mike johnson got a no as well jonathan cheng got a no too i think everyone got a no interesting i never thought about it like that but i guess it is a fairly large city it's very spread out that's very brave of liam but we should probably check the height restriction first i think caleb might be tall enough liam isn't i'm always available for any roller coaster i'm shopping around for an s7 did you find anything useful from your research s7 edge worth it very simple and nacho being mostly on blue will make him easy to mask my 15 minute attempt let me know if you'd rather turn it over to the

silverlake i am glad caleb was happy :-) sorry i missed today i had a mole removed this week and the sore is still a little tender i should be able to make it next week though think of place you'd

there are three kids areas and we didn't get there until 1 hey mike i'm in orlando and i have half a day to go to a theme park here tomorrow any suggestions on where i should go how about tomorrow afternoon i'm sick in meetings all day i'm open from 12 to 2 or after 6 yes please come do lunch soon i just put my first adobe application in 47339 senior analysis manager adobe digital insights yes although i don't work in lehi mind if i make an introduction on linkedin she just left myriad so the two of you have something in common there i had kind of heard that before i went to law school but wasn't willing to do the phd so i just came hoping it wasn't true it turns out that it is more or less true though i don't think necessarily true if you have some industry experience there are two kinds of patent attorneys: one is the one who writes the patents (patent prosecution) and then the other is the one who litigates the patents (patent litigation) you absolutely don't need a phd to litigate in the biotech and there are plenty of good jobs to be had for someone with just an undergrad in the biosciences my job this summer is at a ip boutique firm that does a lot of both prosecution and litigation but i am pretty sure they gave me an offer so that i can litigate (which i think would be my second choice but i think could still be enjoyable) however after taking classes i have found that i am kind of interested in entrepreneurs and stuff so i think i could enjoy doing that though i haven't necessarily switched away from ip since i still love the sciences i am still a scientist at heart hey dan in a few days you'll probably be getting a call from a guy named sean westover he's my financial advisor he is looking for new people to work with and he wanted to know if i had any sharp friends he works with northwestern mutual and has quite a few attorney clients if you're already set up with a financial advisor just tell him so but if you need financial advice he's a good guy to work with i'm drowning in business actuallydo you need help with slides or material though materials would be great i was just going to show them my ancestry account but i bet you have some great stuff he travels a lot and was actually just in utah he is the one that will personally fit you my husband has 5 of his suits how much do they go for awesome yeah the bay is the place to be might be able to find a co tact at genentech what's the best email address to reach you by cburton@byunet or collincburton@gmailcom universal had escape from greengots for hp it's good but not as good as forbidden journey at ioa may be worth the trade for the other good rides universal closes at 5 today so that settles this issue what dates are you going to be in san diego over christmas haha what a silly did they change the code for the clerk room can you tell me what it is if it changed recently i still want to come but andrew has a family thing that day as well i might ask laura to come or

nice i can't believe the first day is already gone i wish i had two weeks here it's amazing i saw many places offering paella but my friend helen that i brought with me is a vegetarian sooo not yet

places that offer a vegetarian option try out some jamon serrano as well spain has some of the best pork dishes you will have anywhere oohh i am not in the best planning mood right now though get back

about the wagoner ranch outside of vernon have tickets for the mavs game tomorrow yet oh got it i was going to say one way to get your father talking is to ask him how he woluld feel if your brother brought someone home like i said that makes it more real i brought that up he just said we'd deal with it when it came up oh really from where old yearbook i'll tag you in it if you don't mind my goal is to track down everyone right and herein lies the problem one necessarily implies theother it's treated in a similar manner to any form of sex outside of marriage there is not punishment for someone with gay feelings who chooses not to act on them i had an econ professor at byu sum it up succinctly if you have an itch it doesn't mean you have to scratch it i know you probably don't agree with that i'm just trying to explain our views oh man that sounds like fun "friends of mike van dusen" sounds like i died though i'll need a better name :) i'm at a conference 29th- july 1st but we're going to hang out with family either the week before or after well either way i'll reach out again when we get closer it'd be a blast to catch up absolutely if you want a lot of people make a facebook event if you just want to hangout with me that's cool too 😃 you're welcome let me know if you have any questions about our interviews otherwise good luck i'll be rooting for you by the way any chance

maybe you had already decided best of luck making your decision ha i have to check it out when going back hello collin hi am i even close not quite for a you have the dominant phenotypes you need the alleles i'll give you a hint; p^2 = 25 if you haven't watched the khan academy hardy weinberg video yet do that because the whole thing is walking through this problem the only difference is in the phenotype frequency i just found out that amanda is out till thursday i don't know if you have another way to get a hold of her but could you pass on the info about t-shirt voting to her through something besides her work email she will miss the voting if she waits till she gets back on thursday thanks so i saw alec's email today are you guys in desperate need of some apms well i don't have to look for a job i love my job and get to keep it keep an eye out for houses oh yeah right one idea might be to rent for a year and get accustomed to the city and what parts you like and how much things cost it gives you more time to decide there's quite a few houses for rent where i'm at for around $1200/month let me know when you have a free moment on saturday or sunday when you are here so how's utah working out for you so far lol hey just curious what's the sq footage of your place and how much did you end up buying it for ( it's not rude to ask because you're my brother) we are looking into buying within the next few years once the market has dropped we're renting it still we are getting a steal of a deal $800/month i'm looking up the footage 1325 square feet it should be renting for around $1500 a month daniel we do i'm going to be driving for the next few hours so i may not respond quickly for a while good question i would like to i want to make sure there are people there whose company i will enjoy the ones posting on the fb group i don't really remember maybe i'll have to find my yearbook i'll probably take the weekend off and spend some time at home sounds nice you going bringing the family also i think i'll be in salt lake area in early april i will let you know more when i make definite plans that would be awesome if you stopped by in salt lake i'm in a house now so we have plenty of room i'm asking around to a bunch of people to see if they are going to the reunion so far the response has been timid nobody seems that sold on it there's a few of us that are going to the beach on saturday so we can bring our kids along feel free to come to that you still coming to salt lake what time of day do you want to visit evenings are better for me either saturday or sunday probably sunday actually i get out of church at 3 on sunday but i am going to a play on saturday at 2 which means i propbably won't be home until 5 it's all the same to us did you

you that is awesome their address is 366 north 1170 west provo ut 84601 the website i was telling you about is wwwtheanoucom great seeing you again tonight it was really fun wedding glad to know your job is still going really well yes come run i can't i'm still getting over some achilles tendinitis we need to grab lunch sometime and catch up wonderful was supposed to have an not by the way lol i ran into brad hoke at pslive he mentioned you were here i hope you are enjoying it come say hi if you spot me everyone's in hiding at least from me i honestly feel that the real argument is over the definition of rights as guaranteed by the constitution and minor rights (privileges) that accompany general freedom honestly if marriage was a true right that cannot be infringed than the government would not only have to allow it but ensure that every man and women who wanted to be married ended up with a spouse just like they ensure that old or young good looking or ugly stupid or brilliant all have a actively protected right freedom of speech any chance you could send that to me in an email it's a little hard to read like this husband to the rescue invited 50+ people and only 5 showed up well you found a winner - that looks great now i just a raise at mygn or maybe we could get eric to take us there for the next dept lunch ;-) only $150/person put it on the kaizan board i came here by shuttle no worries thank you anyways collin have a great day good luck with the new semester you too see you on campus you too collin - i'm so glad we made it happen i know my dad is always looking for someone to sail with so anytime you are in san diego or orange county and want to go out- give him a call will do any luck trying to contact mary lou gotcha like ben cool i had an interview today with a startup in sf they asked me how comfortable i'd feel building a team of data scientist/engineers the problem is they sell a vapor cigarrete nicotin and cannabis so probably not a great fit but if i see something i'll let you know thanks yeah hard to work for a product that you are never going to try yourself s7 is a great phone edge or not i'm sure you'll like it looking forward to it how was the drop floor slide do you miss myriad at all ;-) any connections would be great i'd love to learn a little more about their internal culture be ready to work your butt off good luck :) i'm sure the guys at q will take good care of you i'm in slc what is this magical banking strategy you speak of just domestically customers conventions sales field rides special projects vendors field sales meetings etc hmm you might see my resume i still have to decide we are coming out there april 4th to the 8th looking for a house cool i'm in boston from the 3-5 but i'll be around after that you should come to church with us they are using a broad based illumina chip - 23andme developed a custom chip - essentially an exome chip the ancestrydna "group" lack integrity big time - they will take advantage of you and stab you in the back as fast as they can look at youi'd be careful interesting perspective i know we're 2 months over duewho has something exciting coming up in the next 6 months or so and wants to take pancho along for the ride maybe it should be the last one to add pancho as their friend scott christofferson i'll let you know if there is an opening the one i'm applying for yes cool will make intro awesome thanks if it helps here is the link for the facebook internship https://wwwfacebookcom/careers/departmentreq=a0ia000000g3eeqmab good move then eh kudos i'll have to look at their site again to see if they need someone as awesome as me to help out hopefully i should have done something other than waste 2 years on that damn pmst program too old to do something different now yeah that thing has not helped me much at all it did help me discover statistics but the degree itself has not done much for me hmm i would guess maybe 1/2 a step below that no long white gloves good news for me my wife still fits in her prom dress from high school thanks collin you might already know this but your profile says you don't \"vale\" means ok sometimes they'll say \"venga\" in front of it as well which also means ok how long have you been there dejohnallen@gmailcom what's your email address collincburton@gmailcom done http://christiannewsnet/2015/12/07/confirmed-dinosaur-blood-on-ancient-fossil-astonishes-evolutionists/ so i was having a "discussion" with a friend of mine about evolution and how it is real and he of course doesn't believe it because of the whole 7000 year time line he sent me this article given that i am scientifically illiterate is it bs i know they have been extinct for tens of millions of years however i don't understand half of the scientific terms looks like their website is down at the moment to be continued 🙏🙏🙏 have a fun family 4th of july celebration you too haha yeah i needed to get this first one updated so i can start working on the others you have others just kidding lol haha see you later time for bed good night patrick is willing to write me a check for 1000 and that will pay for the venue dj and food what do you think collin but i would have to pay him back with the money coming in he could give me the money this weekend i'll look up the refund stuff but i'd rather take the mindset that we aren't going to have to refund anything because we are going to sell at least 100 tickets ok- email me or swing by in the morning i dont have my calendar up lol you

officially gone by my middle name which is what my parents always called me since college let's see i was involved in sports in high school but nothing really in film or the creative arts other than dance i got my start working with the wayans brothers right after college i then was discovered by harvey weinstein at a film festival and he partnered with me to produce my first tv series since then i've created a number of series work with some of the most amazing people in tv and film and launched my own production company in 2011 there's really so much to that has gone into the journey but i have a movie filming now that will be out next year and renee zellweger and i just sold a series that she's going to star in:) thank you again and let me know if i can send you anything else sounds good let me know if you ever head out here to utah for sundance they need an email address for you as well so they can let you know if you won it's interesting how some of the tests are kinda subjective to how you translate like i used vosotros conjugation and it marked it wrong yeah it's not perfect but it's pretty good it's gotten much better over the years good to know what part of slc do you live in we have some friends moving up there and they need to find a place to live asap do you know if anyone renting we live in holladay there's a few apartments next to us but i'm not sure if they are renting right now or not what price range are they looking for i don't know if these guys have availability but it's a nice area http://wwwturnberryaptscom/ sent it weird i'll have to ask around yeah but i'm confused by your question as opposed to the non-relationship andrew last time i was down there it seemed like it wasn't a sure thing do you have an estimate of the "future" i was wondering if it along term or near term like how long i'll be at symantec oh when they plan to move north i'm not entirely sure how long it will be i think they are looking at sites now my guess is at

just wanted to let you know it was a possibility perfect - give me a bit of time and i'll send over the rest of the ones i want - i'll take out identifying info and things under 5 cms ok however adoptees are increasingly using dna testing to identify bio family (long lost family on tlc) due to sealed records i've been doing that type of work for the last 4 years and there are very few that understand how to do that so they convinced me to come and work for them and pay a boat load of money right ☺️ sweet thank you so much i'm trying everything to get the perfect dough; and from your pics this may be what i'm looking for and the honey seems like a great touch to sweeten the dough it's all about the water content that sounds interesting what's their percentage rubios and noodles are both 20% i know chili's does it too but they are only 10% no idea hey collin any chance you'll see dan snow tomorrow like at a pro-sem or supply chain lunch or otherwise nothing is scheduled we

things to go listen to one can always learn something new as genealogy is ever changing hey rod do you know if there is a young single adult ward in our area we have some relatives that might be moving in and they wanted to know if they still have a singles ward around here or if they got rid of it good chatting yup good luck with things thanks don't know if you have seen this in the news yet but there's been a lot of press about an openly gay man in san francisco who is currently serving in a high ranking position http://religionblogscnncom/2011/09/24/church-leadership-post-for-an-openly-gay-mormon/iref=allsearch are you going to go to the reunion -matt i had to delete your comment because i realized i made a typo in my original post just thought i'd tell you right on did you make it to the venter lecture hey how's june 28th for dinner i think that will work yeah - but this is the thing - ethnicity estimates will always rely on inferring that a current population is representative of populations as they were 500-10000 years ago they will never be "accurate" because of that the "cousin" matching part is useful (i think) for genealogy the ethnicity not so much not ancestry brca testing among other things it's a direct competitor to myriad that charges $4000 what is the best number to reach you send me a calendar invite with your number to collin_burton@symanteccom and i'll call you at 10 not having to carry the kids would make hiking much easier i imagine growing up vacation me at camping

mormon day on saturday i have never been a fan of the "ipad on the wrist" aesthetic so this is perfect for me it has almost anything i could want from a smart watch i don't need to play games or use apps on my watch i just like it for timekeeping and being able to read notifications it vibrates and i can customize the vibration patterns for each type of notification i can also set silent alarms gps tracking do you think the network might be nice to have or are the chapters out here kind of weak that much i don't know i haven't gotten any follow ups from either one so my guess is no you have

use existing ones and adjust parameters i'm building them i'm probably a junior data scientist now perfect that would be very helpful i'm hoping since gmi and gtech are so different that they won't mind chatting with me a bit with stuff like culture i imagine that they would be pretty open if you want to talk about drug research or ip that's another thing hey man hope all is well i would suggest that you reach out to jayne heart in hr it's pretty last minute so i'm not sure how likely it will be downtown library has some great deals on space too thanks for the info if you want to attend or

old and not have a credit history you there yes what's up i will show this message to laura i had no idea what she was going to do and i would really like to not be the in between here i think both

like they did i agree let's move on and forget it happened sorry to put you in the middle my husband thinks so too he really likes them hey stephanie okay so you want to date my personal assistant she's more in to long distance digital only relationships hm only street parking this is fine overnight but you'd need to move it every 2hrs during the day street parking should be fine i'm visiting a company in the morning anyway so it shouldn't be a problem see you tomorrow i wish i went primarily because i needed to have more structure and there are opportunities with genealogy and dna that no other company can offer we will see if things pan out hey angie are you still at ancestry i have a friend who just joined there and i'm trying to connect her with some people are you coming there are

you start do you know if we can still access our previous classes in learning suite i could not find all of them but the ones in the last semester i'd like to check out a course i took in the 3rd semester probably not the professors tend to remove them after time my biggest concern with this is that he is usually very busy it sounds like the data mining with this won't be too difficult because it should be already laid out in domo for us good point on the busy aspect were you a 31-32 waste in high school i think so i'm out right now but i'll check when i get home a little bit she showcased the new cleaning stuff she bought me and had me do it sounds like mom at check is fine too it just goes slower my address is 3946 s 2700 e salt lake city ut 84124 paypal address is bing_kc@hotmailcom $40 should cover it i was hoping for crazy adventures from you ;) *whoops wrong window hope the mahesh intro helped - he's good leads a team of data analysts at fb should be able to describe position and maybe put in good word if you impress him how's your sql also any good at python scripting yes thanks for the intro hopefully he can help if it works out i could probably stop by and visit while i'm sitting around waiting for the google interview on friday my sql is pretty good i used it for about 5 years at my last job i wasn't to an engineer level by any means but if those guys were busy and needed something ad hoc they usually came to me that would be awesoe awesome i love that idea we spoke together at a westminster mba class on monday so we know eachother a bit more now k do you have any preference for when we get there the catch is we have to be on the same flight as its a companion ticket so there are a couple different options i'd prefer leaving later that wednesday night if that works for you let me take a look at my calendar i haven't started planning for this yet but i know i'm probably going to have to go is there a specific airline we have to go on •	improved cash

believe it and is wicked smart i hope he can transition to product but from my limited experience it's really hard you need to be very lucky good to know he would be good with that analytics position too haha yeah hard to tell hope its comfortable remember how i asked you how you keep up with everything the other day my roommate just asked me the same thing kind of funny thanks for letting me crash at your place it was nice so now that you have this written you can do it for anything right i may have friends that want one any way to standardize the x-axis oh and i would tell my friends

sure if i came across as enthusiastic google was cool except that it's ruined any other job because the perks will never be as good did you think it was smaller what's been not as good being in a smaller office it doesn't feel like a big company they had a data scientist there that jeff dotson spoke very highly of he quit the day before i got there i was hoping to learn from him it looks like

don't deploy that boat we might be able to finish choke point if you got an attack in joanna mountain a few others a bit below her but she's probably the best person to make an introduction to https://www23andmecom/about/leadership/ i will be interested to see if they make the drugs development work - as you know that seems to be something myriad could never do no matter how hard they tried *drughave to run errands but will be back myriad never really included the genetic aspect into it though they just did conventional development i'd love to talk to joanna thanks for the introduction it's not magic it's math 😎 so is it paying twice a month snowballing from the highest rate to the lowest those are the only ones i'm familiar with i think so we are excited for the snow and all we need as a family are a pair of boots for me (i am procrastinating) and a couple of sleds the couple of times it snowed here have been awesome it looks like this next storm is going to be a little more intense the snow might actually stick around for a few days oh nice i felt like because i ran no significant amount of running i had to go big 25 is a lovely ride yeah i have ragnar the week after that as well gotta save some leg how far back are you i saw you pass echos mile you guys went too far let me know what you think i just got my copy my wife and i are going to read it we have too much marital detritus spread around our house im sure legalizing same sex marriage will help the city/state for sure i haven't seen it yet but there's a movie about mormons out in theaters now i hear it's

good to know if i move to california i'll try to get you to follow do you mountain bike sorry i'm in a group meeting for the next while we'll talk later uncle blaine thanks for the donation impreza had the lowest maintenance costs jimmy i talked to her today and she said she had a really good time at church and met a lot more people she mentioned you too and said she could tell you wanted to ask her out but didn't play lode runner is tim with you he just sent me something similar yes emily was out here last minute so we hung out for a bit fixed was 5 something i need to get around to doing that soon as well no i've heard of those methods as well but this is different the biweekly payment schedule method does save you interest and pay it off sooner but it eats up your reserves and you lose the liquidity of your money the snowball method is pretty popular as well but it does not take into account the cash flow index (efficacy) of a debt which is usually more effective way of prioritizing which ones to pay off first the one i learned is called velocity banking we've been doing it for almost a year and we paid off $218000 in debt you set it up with your same bank you're using already it's pretty sweet i am out of town right now but i'll be back in two weeks i'll hit you up when i'm back and figure out when we can meet ok awesome thank you karen tells me you guys are heading down to manti on thursday for the pageant we're planning on going down at that time too we should carpool or something what time are you leaving hows the cold treating you it feels warm now getting rain beets the single digits from last week i ran into your brother chase at church today find the pictures from last night on my website the link is on my profile maybe that am i could do before 915 have fun the route i have for ragnar has big uphill and downhill up to snow basin from the reservoir and down to park city from the top of guardsman pass 󾍁 i don't know the latest on you and karen but i heard you all have basically set a dateis this true yep we have the temple reserved in san diego for september 22nd we're looking at the cancun area for a honeymoon basically all i'm waiting for to get engaged is a ring and a little time alone did you really get called to be bishop that's pretty crazy if it's true good luck with that i'm sure you will do well thanks so where are you thinking of applying have you done harry potter it's the most technically impressive attraction there that's what i was thinking but which one should i go to yeah it took me awhile but late than never good luck with school and all and i'll probably see you later so i talked to my cousin and she says you're cute you should think about asking her out she's looking for some good friends so if you could help her get to know more people in the ward she would really appreciate it here's a hint for you you'll score big points if you open doors for her i was runner 4 and loved being in van 1 what was your team start time i think it was like 630 or something like that i know i had to get up at around 2 when you go in van 2 you can sleep in yup can't wait to hit it up looks amazing my little bro is actually thinking about flying out just to visit and go i gotta make a trip too drew brown might be out in ohio as well did you go to the rib festival yeah nicole had told me they were making an offer but it wasnt for sure yet ie accepted yet i've thought about making the jump ya- we had a 7:30am start time it makes for a long day so which one do you want to do next i am a tax accountant in boston loving being back in the east life is going pretty good i am taking the last section of the cpa exam on monday so my 4th will not be the best but after that i will be done which is a nice thought hope all is well and once again congrats karen and i were in the same ward we went to a birthday party of a mutual friend and met there we got married september of last year and were enjoying it a lot i went into molecular biology and now work in product development at myriad genetics here in salt lake i'm planning on going to grad school next year we'll have to see what place i can get into wes i'm gonna be heading home for thanksgiving in november we should go do something when is your thanksgiving break well i doubt joining would push you outside of your moral and religious framework because my understand ing is that it's just a support group it actually might be helpful to joint one in slc given that there are probably plenty of mormons in that chapter utah chapters are in slc ogden and saint george well if i end up needing support i'll know of a place to go that would be awesome it looks like i'm your new home teacher damn ;-) it's a reference book not really something you read cover to cover that's a long time to keep everyone in the dark that just sounds so painful yeah i'm sure there were lots of tough moments monday is a holiday any exciting plans we might go on a hike up ensign peak that's about all we have this is gonna be you're lifel as soon as caleb can talk welcome to parenthood where do you know andrea krueger from she's in my dance class ha that's funny you finding other work than bi i think so i proposed doing a regression on some salesforce com data and nobody seemed to be bothered by the idea it would be a great project for the analytics class but the timing isn't right i simply converted the segment data from the csv files into vectors to feed to the iranges and used the usual r plotting functions ok that makes more sense :( more will come it's just the beginning did you reach your goal last year barely it's usually the same couple of family members each year oh really i spent the summer there for my internship best summer in a long time ahhh interesting were students stressed about the prospect of going to a bar not as much with the mba students we are a little more mature and have been around for the undergrads it's a bigger issue that and making sexist comments unknowingly ok i got my new watch what type so glad to hear that sorry for the short answer i'm in the middle of coding vlinton@vlcmtechcom thanks i think he might be done now but if he needs more people he'll be in touch good luck hopefully it works out for you yeah it will probably be fine hey do you still have my star wars movies yes thank you very much for the extended rental i apologize for keeping them so long i'm guessing you want them back now haha i'm not even sure how he got those in his name i hope you've been enjoying them :):):) they go right in the trash as long as you guys aren't getting charged or missing them i guess the next person that moves in here will enjoy them as a bonus awesome - good luck tmrw i'm actually wrapping up my islamic tour am in zimbabwe heading north to congo trying to understand aid at the moment before heading home and getting a real job really appreciate the offer though and hope youre' doing great back home say hit o the wife and kids for me hey dwight i found a role on facebook that i'm interested in i realize you don't work at facebook anymore so you probably can't give me an internal referral but i wanted to know if you had any other ideas on how to get out of the general application pool here's the position i'm looking at https://wwwfacebookcom/careers/jobs/a0i1200000g56aueaz/q=data%20scientist&location=menlo-park so when should i expect your pymt in the mail i'll get it in the mail tomorrow myriad isn't long for this world anyway that's why i'm getting an mba among many reasons not that i know of here's what i was able to find on facebook first one is his sophomore year of hs with a friend this would be circa 1987 second one is he and his five siblings with their bishop circa 1984 sorry they're no higher res those are spectacular let me know if you find any more it's a bit of a game to see who can find the most embarrassing picture of the teachers we found one of our marketing teacher when he had a mullet we sprung it on him in a class presentation so you are passing through cleveland on memorial day i'm happy to come up if you are available totally understandable if you can't squeeze it in i know you are traveling and on a time line i may be able to talk ralph into it perhaps after he sees the

officially retired again ralph just retired june 2nd ok can i have your email so she can send you more info yeah good call :) and i'm guessing brett scott or zach talked to that manager i'm not positive but it sounds like a position they would have been interested in o hopefully we can get a connection that way too brett is hooking me up with some more info as well where do they go rafting in idaho it's better rafting than moab both are fun though the job i got after graduating is just down the road from byu in lindon i'll probably see you sometime bwaaaak bwaaaak (chicken noises) :) i had a friend graduate from high school on time while missing an entire year's worth of classes i'm thinking about doing something similar with the mba ;) so how was the interview my presentation went

company party last year no it was done by espn do you guys want to bring gazpacho elfi thanks i'm good i just keep having conflicts on saturday morning yeah it will probably be fine do you know if

have an old s3 with a slightly cracked screen cool well here is my number 5208403098 i would love to meet up with you what brings you to salt lake also he should learn french italian and german and most importantly how to read music-piano lessons help with that mostly he should just have fun and do something he loves doing he just started piano a few weeks ago keep me updated i think i'll be ok after i iced and stretched last night the pain went away i think i'll do 3 miles on monday so not sure if you heard shane is leaving the company too wow i didn't know that also can the x-axis be in millions of bases rather than in exponents can do yes and mikes pastries really are the best hey abby it looks like i'm going to be dan snow's new ta anything i should know about working for him also how's emc treating you wow very cool you and your ragnar team are amazing thanks the post i wrote about recruiting for a ragnar team has 429 views so far it's my best work yet glad it isn't greek to you that iranges package is key for making these i think i have everything i need to get going i think it will take me about 3-4 hours of work most of that will be learning the iranges package and writing the first pass of the code how much were you thinking compensation wise it's the microbiology club somehow they managed to make it a class we meet about once a month or so and go on lots of cool field trips like to the crime lab yellowstone and biotech companies i'd hardly consider it a class do you still live in slc cloudflare is most likely where they will end up thomas our previous cfo is in talks with shane and that is something travis is interested in and he said shane will want to pull in the whole team there at some point so some people would like to stay here till that happens my guess crazy stuff hey sorry for no response because of fall break i am not online everyday you should text me next time then i can give you a quick response 619-871-3831 i forgot about fall break you around tomorrow sounds great 2p coffee work for you that will work see you then yes sir was that your first time at fiddlers (on saturday) yeah as you can imagine i don't go to bars too often yeah that makes more sense and now i do remember when you got the new gig i still have my symantec swag backpack- so thank you that's really cool though i understand they are doing some really interesting and cool stuff over there i tried to get in myself but don't have the computing/tech background and certainly don't have the data analytics capabilities you have since then i have realized that my real strengths may be more in line with b to b sales roles at companies like symantec kinda kick myself for not realizing that back when i was in the middle of the job search happy birthday okay thanks hey julia adobe in san jose just posted an internship in analytics that i'm interested in do you have any contacts there that i would be able to talk to yeah the way that i interpret that is he probably had his own suspicions i asked him about that and he said he was totally surprised i don't think he had a clue lol moab i actually had more fun on the supply chain trip your presents are coming up with emily sorry they will be late jeez that's a rough christmas for vince hopefully next year will be better for him i'm glad you liked your presents we are the proudest of mike's his is calvin and hobbes themed karen says if they get damaged or anything she can make a replacement it's her first time making them so she might not have done it right i sent this in an email but i'm not sure if the address still works caleb wants to do a video chat with his cousins again could we set one up ive made the survey from qualtrics and wouldnt want to remake it for mechanical turk is that ok i can just provide a link and do u know how much it would cost yeah that's totally fine most people on there build their survey somewhere else they have lots of training on their website to explain how it works there's a lot of ways you can screw it up too so maybe try a few trials first to make sure you get it right the cost is variable and is set by you if you pay more it will be finished quicker if you don't pay enough it may never finish it's been a while since i used it but i think around $025 per survey seems about right fine by me are you going to go out tonight sounds good hey collin have you ever heard of the national society of leadership and success yeah i got a mailer from them a few months ago i didn't think it was worth it i got a golden key one more recently i don't think they really do anything for you we are still looking we see lots with spots but they won't let us in saying they're full gotta save some for your buddies it's going to take a very long time to get out of here yeah im going to do that today and post it on the facebook page and also the address list im also going to make a spreadsheet check in for the door to check off people and to collect money for those who havent paid in advance sounds like a plan ha that's great it looks like i'm going to be in ohio for the summer you should come out and hit up cedar point with me true their vus rate for brca is 2% their best competitors are around 4% haha i think it was as much confused as anything bit sad - mum was dead so we at least got the kid out but still big question whether it can find the herd nature can be less kind than i think we picture it :/ anyway i wouldn't worry toooooo much about cs background for data science role natural selection is a pretty hellish place to live in ok might just copy it to a cd then for the am ok thanks yeah it is at springville art days tomorrow evening but they told us yesterday that they don't have room for us anymore really lame i know so we won't be playing there as of now but yes we are playing at 8 at muse tonight and then we are playing next wednesday at velour's battle of the bands and we really need people there for that

my more experience and the name so it's not a bad gig one was interim so it was expected the new one is from a company we bought we bought them and they basically get to take over symantec not necessarily a bad thing given our track record /wwwfacebookcom/bbettinger/posts/520359246776 i've got a guy in my stake that is getting his master's degree in genetic genealogy he asked me to take a look at his dissertation i thought you might be interested care to take a look hi hey the invites them selves and a couple envelopes hope you have a good night man - and grab a bag of ice you'l

had to watch some more videos and google some stuff well it seems like you have it now wow are you job searching or is it but that bad yet not that bad yet ok thank you that will be great too i mention that foot bridge because it could be a bottleneck for bike riders there's some sharp turns on it and if a lot of people are trying to get through at once it could be very crowded and crash prone -g thanks i'll do my best on saturday my run today felt really good the book is cookwise by shirley o corriher no way is your job stressful don't work too hard man job isn't too stressful we just forgot to look into something we did a bit of traveling over the summer so we didn't think about it to much are you going to do anything fun in austin i'm taking my license test today hopefully i don't fail b/c mom's too busy canning to take me out driving this week booo so since you are now in a relationship does that mean that you have been doing the smoochie smoochie i enjoy it a lot feel like i can do many things with any data i've been doing a lot of fuzzy matching in python no worries collin the only reason i might be concerned is if she notices that her name is not in the scroll if she asks i'll let you know otherwise don't worry at all :) any updates what flight number are you on hey buddy we just found out that our moving pod won't arrive until monday so no need to worry about coming on saturday yeah just saw the post i'll see what i can do are you still arriving saturday cool thanks did you get to watch them yep we got through most of them the kids weren't quite ready yet got it thanks so much hope it helps you network for ft too :) did you ever hear back from the contacts i sent i have a few more people i can reach out to yep but they don't like me much there so i'm not sure that a recommendation from me would go anywhere good to know i talked to a recruiter from there and they said they will be growing that division a lot over the next couple of years is your deadline maybe midnight you still have time thanks don't know yet can you text my phone i can't find it sent collin thanks for the message i am in riviera little far to come up there ah thought you

jordan did you grow up near farmington let's do it what do you guys have in mind maybe just a short local hike something like bell canyon reservoir how old are your kids gotcha lol can you send me your phone number that you use on wechat i will i'm doing really well this week i've been swimming every night and taking it easy things are better now that i can be active again good too bad about the phone not working out awesome do you have a info page for him just his linkedin profile there's a podcast or two out there too https://wwwlinkedincom/in/bentaylordata he'd probably need a little coaching to make sure he didn't go too technical but i'd say he's 90% of the way there especially with someone that's this technical 25 attached and 75 non attached there are no alleles because there is a dominanat dominant no that is the phenotype alleles are e and e so you just got a new job yes but i have to keep it quiet because i have bonus money coming in soon 2 more weeks to go i'm worried

you get into boston april 3 in the afternoon i leave april 5 around 4 i think are you going to be around i was just in nauvoo illinois this last weekend i guess that's pretty close i thought you had

from him last night looks like he's doing fine but can't use facebook anymore for whatever reason really cool it's how netflix knows which type of show you'll like personalized recommendations they are launching a new soy bean that is resistant to two pesticides they are also launching the other pesticide (besides roundup) that's big a lot of weeds are starting to evolve roundup resistance if you hit them with two toxins at once it becomes harder to build up resistance at least that's the hope anyway i really do think that statistics is the only useful math - but just never got around to taking any in-depth classes on it it's all connected hey collin daniel said that you might be looking for a roomate to share the costs on a national black do you still need that person yes it's still open (y) oops i'm learning monte carlo simulation it's pretty cool stuff sounds great the one in cleveland is kind of a mix of a beer garden and food truck roundup except it's bbq there's a few kid things to do but not much i hear there is one in cuyahoga falls that is a little more kid friendly lol dang that's awesome i think i put your linkedin profile information in the description hopefully it's come back to you in some ways that might explain all of the random requests from india i get do you still have the creds for the channel i'm curious what the analytics say nvm i got them from christie thanks collin it is nice to hear from you i hope you are doing great do i know you from somewhere how about 8 sounds good call me when you are ready 801-636-3261 looks like this might not be

good at remaining composed under pressure i never knew that thanks for your help there are still more people coming i might extend the pymt time for a couple more days but thats it do you think we

friends are coming and will be more encouraged to go i see you have 4 people looking to share a hotel at the nbmba conference do you have place for two more sorry it already has 4 people in it and i

database of tested people and then the genealogical information they have - its like the utah population database on steroids maybe they will spin off a pharma company like 23andme sure cmpetrone@comcastnet thanks her name is gabrielle cunningham hey collin mt whitney feels like such a long time ago i hope to do it again some day with darryl i love hiking in japan because so many people of all ages are active here we saw young kids who were maybe 7 or 8 elderly couples in their 70's at least and everyone in between summit yesterday on other trails we have even seen women in kitten heels dominating my arthritic vb knees hinder my decent but my dr says i just need to lift more i am walking through spain at the end of this month with a friend on el camino de santiago 500 miles in 28 days it's great to see pics of your family's adventures how have you been thanks for writing back things are going well here in utah there's so many adventures to go on here especially now that my kids are getting older and i don't have to carry them all the time i'm pretty familiar with the camino i lived in spain for two years i was more in the center of madrid so i wasn't right by it but i did hear about it quite a bit it should be an awesome experience i forget are you catholic i'm happy to share any tips and insights about spain if you are ever curious i am still curious why the japanese went with that analogy does anyone want to see whats behind the kimono ha i wonder if the japanese actually say that or if it's just something a us marketer came up with enjoy denver wish i was there yeah there was one that printed metal there motorcycle parts like engine tubing they also printed in rubber getting better thanks man that must be so tough we do need to hang out soon someplace besides tao nightclub haha you got it nice looking house ahhh see - running is bad ive been trying to tell you this for years :-) the whole thing was fun overall and the run would have been fun to if i trained better why would you do that i'm curious to see what he's up to he's always good for a laugh thanks a lot:) hi what is your track which section are you in section 1 supply chain you hahaha hmmm i typically only work 8 or 9 but more is expected of a pm and travel 1x per month is about avg hmm hey collin are you planning to move for work or continue living holladay we are exploring options right now we won't move anywhere until after work starts what are you thinking in that area ok so here's an interesting question what happens with your brother's status in the mormon church how does that all work in reality the layman's perception is that there is some sort of ex-communication that goes on he hasn't gone since he left san diego any of those sound appealing if not thats fine too but that's what i've ripped so far let's do a roller coaster and the lion king same here where are you guys staying i might be able to stop by for a short while tonight tomorrow is pretty busy that is weird i have no idea it looks like arnold and stallone maybe the replaceables you're the best (then again maybe i should wait and see what the first one looks like) always a good plan :) hahahahaha how's your birthday going so far aren't you in the middle of finals yeah my birthday always happens right in the middle of finals it kind of gets looked over by most people because they're busy with everything else thanks for remembering me ha awesome you'd be surprised to know that yours shoots harder than all the big ones we dubbed it the noisy cricket not bad for $7 i shot my wife with that thing last night and it left a small welt that's a lot of oomph yes so happy for you now when/if i come up to visit i can see you and emily at the same time ok i think you are caught up now oh wow nice your secret is safe with me you may already know this one but i saw a website you might like http://hackertypercom/ don't blame you do you have any home defense tools turnberry we looked at turnberry a few years ago good decision to not take it i'll barely survive with $35 in the bay area thanks for your support it was really nerve wracking to turn something down without another offer on the table where is your cruise going to if you are inactive i would love to help you come back what congrats i'm not accepted just thinking about applying next year thanks for coming down i'm in a lecture with dr wittwer today any ideas for questions to ask him no but the monkeys are full of shit got some more snow down here it should be a good ski season do you mind sharing those findings i don't mind sharing at all i asked a few people and nobody gave me the same answer i got everything from she just had way too much to drink one night to she was just really depressed somewhat ironically the story closest to the truth i got was from jeremy he said the doctor gave her the wrong prescription according the the coroner report the day before she died she was prescribed a new pain killer for her back pain that night she drank about half a bottle of wine mixing pain killers with alcohol is never a good idea but for some reason she didn't know that pain killer was pulled off the market a few years ago because it was shown to not be very effective at dealing with pain and also caused difficulty breathing with some patients my guess is that the alcohol combined with the pain meds caused her to stop breathing in the middle of the night as far as getting the report it only took a couple of emails i have the report somewhere in my email account if you want me to send you a copy you could probably find the one for grandpa as well if you contacted the folsom coroner office or possibly the hospital where he died i think what finally got him was anaphylactic shock for one of the medications they gave him it's basically a severe allergic reaction i'd have to go look it up again though i have seriously been thinking about a phd except the other day i had a member of the admissions committee tell me that a phd is a waste of time and does not guarantee a job i am still leaning that way but the conversation was a bit discouraging so now i am rethinking my options yeah don't do the phd it's a ton of time with little chance for a job your success will be largely based on luck with little chance of payout if the luck doesn't pan out have you thought about pathology i hear they don't have to really see patients at all this comic pretty much sums up the phd path https://upmicfileswordpresscom/2015/02/passionate-about-sciencepng :) i'm excited did you get any interviews scheduled before hand yes let's get together even if it's quick i haven't seen you in forever want to meet at the sheraton or what are your thoughts do you fly out tonight or fly out tomorrow sheraton would work great yay perfect :) i'm thinking that maybe i should send you an updated excel file with the known close relatives removed that would be good for anonymity i'm guessing

and life post mba glad to hear you're doing well i had lunch with travis sabin the other day he's enjoying it there as well symantec has been interesting i've seen two ceos since i started here which is pretty crazy there's not as much data sciencey stuff as i was hoping for it's mostly a lot of sql work worst part is waiting for the drop once that happens the slide is pretty fun it takes away the need to push yourself over the edge was it in texas i'm having a party on wednesday at my apartment you and your roommates should come i think i copied that email address from your mom incorrectly i have jal224@txstateedu since i can't nurse him i just cuddle him for a few minutes and put him back down well i better get up yes that's awesome how are your parents doing do you see them often okay

do have a good one hey it's been a long time i recently saw a call for nominations for the monte vista hall of fame i was thinking i should nominate you i think your story would be inspiring to a lot of high school kids that are either in band black gay or some combination of those i know you are in the law profession and have found success there but i don't know many details beyond that would you be willing to supply some info that would make you sound like a legal rock star i found out about this kind of late and the deadline is tonight can you get it to me by then right let me know when you are free to chat would love to hear your thoughts i'm taking today off let me know when you are free i'm good now if you want very cool you have a pic of your teams before the start i will post on our

science it's been fun working for a tech company i actually would like to see more of it but it seems that it is always a bunch of older people lecturing to them and trying to guilt them into helping it's hard for the youth to relate when someone is yapping at them who thinks a tweet is something a bird says yeah the whole guilt trip thing on the youth extends beyond just family history would it be an inheritance/estate settlement or insurance/pension/retirement did you figure out what day you are coming back yet lol no my in laws house ~15m ok i'm 10 min away i just met some of your former coworkers erin mcnamara and lindsay baluk they are my coworkers now leaving now will probably be a few minutes late :/ from heber yeah do you know elena what track is she she's marketing but i think

director genomics / catherin ball vp genomics and bioinformatics -eric zimmerman vp platforms & infrastructure -dan lawyer vp product management date: wednesday august 24th / time @5pm ancestry headquarters 1300 w traverse parkway lehi ut 84043 warm regards terri sweet thank you so much i found fireworks for you even if he doesn't use crazy randomly generated passwords he needs to keep that data secure and backed up in the cloud did you ever get your kids hooked on line rider what's that what are the online classes you are taking do you have a link search for coursera they have hundreds of free courses thats good 5 miles no pain i feel like i'm back to the point i was before my injury how long do i need to go on saturday you gonna take it not sure yet they have to offer it first i have to get over my pride of switching from cancer research to infomercial products not sure if it will fit you i got it in high school cool i wasn't 100% sure without doing more searching but thought it was worth passing on that second email was informative it looks like they want some people to promote their product for them not sure it would fit with our team so much since myriad is technically sponsoring us but the whole huntsman group may be interested it was all booked for labor day as well we ended up staying teton village snake river lodge and spa affordable and nice we had a 2 bedroom with kitchen and living room ate most meals in the room to save money really cool pool right on the mountain your kids would love it hope you are doing well thanks things are good just finished the mba and i'm working at symantec now in their analytics group it looks like myriad is still plugging along too glad to hear it yeah sounds great what nights are you getting it for i've just started looking i'm thinking of going to one of the parks after the last day though you can get a discounted ticket after 2pm with who two first year students the marina village starboard room from 5to 10 pm is $600 total deposit is $32500 the dj is 350 for 4 hours and needs a $10000 dollar deposit the bar service i found is a standand bar with everything and all they need is a credit card to hold the day which i have just for the reunion and for them we just have to sell a total of $500 in drinks and then we wont have to pay anything but if we dont we would have to pay the difference food i was thinking el pollo loco they have a catering service and that would only cost about $300 i liked the marina village cause they only charge you for the room they also supply tables chairs and linens is that all the costs i'm a little puzzled why it's $30 a head at that price your going to break even after around 40 tickets just to be clear again not complaining here just seeing what we're working with how's are the ticket sales going i'm in new jersey about 40 min out of new york that should be ok did they give you the write up i did on the project no i think i'm getting more info tomorrow russ just came up and said they had some broken spreadsheets that they wanted to see if i could fix i guess the guy that took over them after you left broke them and now he left the company yeah same here we already started intl student orientation just wanted to talk to you about national black conference; i am not sure if i'll be able to go now since i am in your group for lodging i wanted to let you know so that you can open up the spot for somebody else for now i will try to find somebody to get my spot if that's ok with you too too bad you won't be going if you wanted to help find someone that would be great are you going to nshmba hey man how are you doing well how about you good crazy and busy as always how about yourself things are going pretty well i'm in the last semester of the mba program and i already have a job lined up with symantec doing business analytics for them it's a great fit with my interests i'm on the road this week next week school starts up so i'll be in provo most days but fridays are more open how about sep 4 i think i've got a place to staythanks it would be great to say hello though what is your schedule on tuesday i'm completely open after 12:00 when do the interviews wrap up for you no problem at all i still have a lot of writing and preliminary stuff to do i didn't expect you to be so fast i have an idea on how to display your data that will make your blog really stand out we could put some interaction in it so that the graph would change depending on user input it would look something like this http://shinyrstudiocom/gallery/telephones-by-regionhtml instead of region on the left it would say chromosome and the graph would change based on chromosome you select you could then embed this in your blog as an iframe do you want me to intro you i've had an email intro to will one with ben would be good absolutely if they were willing to donate a lot to our team maybe if it was a good product but otherwise not worth it oh well it was worth a shot i'm getting nervous we aren't going to make it at the very least we have enough for one team if we don't make it to 12k i'm fine just taking the top 12 fundraisers -steven not sure if you saw it but i sent an email to your gmail account i can't send facebook messages from work and i didn't know what email address you usually use hi collin how are you i had a quick question my sister in law just moved to colorado and is big into running ultras she recently ran in 7 degree weather and her pants didn't do a really good job of keeping her warm is there a particular brand or type that you use or know of anyone that has any advice i remember you posted something about running in super cold conditions so thought i'd ask any information would be greatly appreciated :) nice to hear from you i just use a cheap pair of nike ones my butt is usually numb by the end but i usually try to limit the miles to around 6 on those days so i don't have to endure too long my jacket is nicer it's a windstopper fleece from rei that i got 10 years ago i've seen a couple of women with a jacket from lulu lemon that drops over the butt similar to a bike jersey design right i'm going to ask him where he puts himself on that scale i'm curious as to what the answer will be i'm trying to find info on martha virginia bayless who was my dad's mom- edward lee thompson virginia was married to earlie lee thompson the son of charlie r thompson where do i know you from again can you tell which types to some extent mainly breast and colon i can send you the originals if you need them what's the best email collincburton@gmailcom i'm glad you kept a copy omg 11 seconds between first shot and final thoughts nuts thought you guys might like this don't forget to invite your friends to the "fight cancer with snow cones and lumpia" event the more people that know about it the better we've had to change the time for this event since the weather doesn't look to be so good for thursday we will now be having the event on tuesday may 1 i hope you can make it don't forget to post the event to your timeline and let your friends know about it just a quick reminder that you can come get some great lunch tomorrow up at myriad genetics and have part of the sale go to support the huntsman cancer institute unfortunately there won't be any snow cones getting the necessary permits proved more of a hassle than it was worth it's been a long time but our parents used to date back in placerville my mom died in 1995 my wife and i are doing some medical history work and we tracked you down thought i'd say hi it's familysearchorg oops ah cool dhruv and jorge zeballos do you have a team there are no masters programs in genetic genealogy where is he going to school strathclyde i guess it's a degree in geneaology palaeographic and heraldic studies it mentions that ham guy who bill nye debated last year so i am assuming it is pretty crazy stuff yeah ham is

individually and trying to not make it take too long wow i feel like a retard what genotype is a heterozygote i have to read to my kid out for a few minutes oh nice i'll be at the survivorship party i

aquarium yesterday if that happens let me know i'd like to go what are you coming to boston for oh i'm going to check out mit sloan and harvard business school nice like what like pinterest is the new big thing pretty good i'm not the best interviewer i think i come across as lacking confidence and i'm working on that i really like the both the roles (ie the first one the recruiter contacted me about and the 2nd role grant interviewed me for) but not convinced i have the specific experience required by the second role how's your pricing study coming along it's going well it should hopefully launch next week absolutely when are you free i won't be home till later what program do you use i'm fond of google hangouts myself oh collin now i remember you your pic didn't show your face so

guidlines go though you don't get excommunicated until you actually have relations with another man if it is a lot of work to do then don't worry about it drive safe fixed the x and y axis no man--i moved to provo a couple of weeks ago why do you ask i live in slc still and i'm trying to find potential carpools if you get a chance can you email me your resume collincburton@gmailcom did you interview at fiber fix they just opened up a ton of positions alec loves to hire from internal i've been talking to casey he says it's like selling your soul but can be fun too i guess that's casey for you well i asked her what her schedule was like and when she would have a little bit of free time but she said she wasn't sure since her schedule always changes so i didn't really know what to say about when to go out however i did get her number so i'll definitely give her a call and then we'll be able to plan something do you know if she wants to go out i take it she would like to since she did give me her number and she said that we should hang out i think you should go for it she is sometimes a little hard to match schedules with though good luck yes currently at the ngs booth probably

finally almost in disneyland bladder cancer my bladder was removed a year ago but the little buggers spread to my lymph nodes i have been doing chemo since last august hang in there k let me know

train museum has some free things outside and some pay things inside there's a playground at the finish line as well that you can kill some time on and i don't really date mormons anymore lol i

friends about our group too if they are looking for a ride product manager well i loosely know this person i met her briefly at a networking event https://wwwlinkedincom/in/smithkenzie/ i'm not at a computer right now but i'm pretty sure i can knock this out in like 15 minutes myself that works too lol i dont want them to use it independently i want them to hire me ha if you create value for them before you talk to them they will want to talk to you more if you created a deck that someone could use for say sexual harassment training and they used it and liked it they will be more than likely to come to you when they need a specialized deck on lab safety with their specific equipment oh really - why didnt she like it i think she didn't really train for it ok i'll be out there january 14-16 let's meet up if we can get it to work out i'm happy to look over his thesis though ok i'll send it your way there might be some new insights for you in it you and i both know about money wasted on

are on other students try and find another shorter internship for 4-8 weeks or you can just relax and spend time with the family which is what i am doing while i work part-time i'm guessing you have to find your own apartment for the internship as well its good learning a lot and meeting tons of great people i thought it was past your bedtime it won't let me invite anyone unless i click that i'm going thanks for finding her it's a juggle and i'm not back to work yet it'll be an adjustment again when i go back i had to hire a property manager and a housecleaner lol i just can't do it all it's

earlier this summer i don't know if anyone else has an offer how about you any interviews set up two amgen and bristol-myers squib boys school and work are enough to keep anyone maxed out i think the

data mining or analysis what's the stuff you like a few of the projects that i did at symantec that i liked which they then killed were doing segmentation of 11m web contacts just based on job title i had to have more detailed info so i did a search for each title on indeed and download 25 jib descriptions i did a k-means segmentation on these words and came up with a bunch of groups was surprised to see over 1000 contacts in the food service industry surprising since symantec is a computer security company good to hear sol and i did pretty good for our average speed toobut man that turn up

seen him in like a decade some mornings i wake up and can clearly see grandma brady in my face sorta scary try that with dad including the lack of hair living in dallas is fine mostly because we like our friends its not even close to as pretty as utah so prepare yourself for that ut southwestern is a solid place with a good reputation what are they recruiting you for my brother is here for his phd which is probably what you would be doing i'm guessing he could answer more of your questions it was their phd in biomedical science program is it your brother steve that is doing his phd there i'll have to get in touch with him and ask him about it if it is no prob it actually buys me time for recruiting hello guys dwight this is collin roueche he's going to be working at facebook this summer in fraud detection collin has a stats background from his undergraduate days and is showing a lot of potential in analytics dwight used to work at facebook but has moved on to create another startup he's been out of the facebook loop for a while but he may have some insights and contacts as you get going there yeah - i knowmy least favorite part of the whole thing ;) i'll bring you some green jello i don't have my phone right now and i didnot set up my account on phone number mine is baded on my qq number hmm maybe i just need your phone number i'm in the blue line if you're passing by we are

problem we used them yesterday in class i can pick up the extras for snow where are you heading to the gym ok thanks any word on team sign ups yet hey collin can you tell me who the patient speakers running this year are you stephanie bataglia jodi vargas cindy timms michelle cole and i can't remember the other one's name but it's michelle's aunt barbara camacho is the last one i need to get that facebook group going again lots of new faces i think i would prefer to live in salt lake valley over utah valley myself but that's not where i got a job i commuted down for 3 years i had different hours than you will though utah valley is a lot different now provo main street has some amazing dining options now i've seen "latter days" and "8: the mormon proposition" both got theatrical runs though so i doubt they're the ones he's thinking of the documentary series pov on pbs did an episode about a married mormon who cheated on his wife with another man and contracted aids other than that i'm not really aware of any other made for tv stuff i just put up a really cute video of caleb when you have some time are you doing telluride this year nice that's exciting i don't like seeing people i feel like are smart and hard working struggling to find internships just represent byu well i think we might be able to start placing more there in the future so did you decide to go with schulman i still haven't received a formal offer yet but i'm leaning that way their hr person has been working off site so he hasn't been able to contact me the places to go are either market square in downtown knoxville it has a lot of local restaurants that are good the old city also is a pretty cool place there are a few bars that play live music barley's is a bar and pizza place in the old city that i really enjoy there's also the goose and gander which is an english pub that i also believe is in the old city i've never been there but i heard it is good there's also a place called the cereal bar all it serves is cereal never been there either but i've always wanted to try it just because it sounds like such an odd place if i think of anything else i'll let you know thanks yes i'm going to create an event on saturday for people to come donate things but don't you live in slc yes i was just going to mention that lol well now that you put it that way25ee and the other two are homo huzzah that's how my science teacher taught it to me does the goat joke make sense now did he get the significance after the talk we'll see let me know what works nothing works we did face time with karen's family on the ipad and skype with our family on the computer that's awesome hope it goes well what company is it anytime man i'll give her my perspective happy birthday that looks sick but my next utah adventure involves a pair of skis and some fluffy powder i checked at zion adventure company they have a deal for $150 where they will give you the basic training you need to start technical canyoneering then you can go and do the subway on your own the next day is it really called obama's zoo and you're up in sl right yes up 8n sl i even have a replacement screen kit i can include -tyler she just started coming to helix ward last week i brought her with me the last time i came she kind of looks latina she got baptized about 6 months ago and is still learning a lot about the church her name is bianca look for the next time you go i'll see if i can find a picture for you same i hope michael johson benj or matt dalton made it through i haven't talked to them yet it's not nathaniel me or chris he wants to get some byu grads in or interns it isn't anything formal yet but if its something that interests you i can out you in contact with him and you can talk to him about opportunities procurement manufacturing his email address is brentmiddleton@aschulmancom i was talking to him about you so emailing him wont catch him off guard i have to talk to equinix to clear up some things in their offer i need to make sure they aren't wanting me to do undergrad work you just increased my batna though so i'll have a lot more confidence going in thank you for that at the very least awesome cant wait to view it was it on vhs yeah karen found it in my parents garage ohhhh that would be awesome too would you consider adopting a mile and getting 14 other people to join you there will be prizescool ones i might consider that send me more details and i'll see if i'm up for it confession i haven't gone to church in 6 years lol tsk tsk why do you use wechat to talk to jonathan cheng it was all dealt with the problem is lack of ticket sales so as of right now there is nothing to be done but prayer :) we couldn't put a deposit down and luckly we didn't we would have been stuck with it so as of now the dealine for ticket sales we set for the end of this month guess we will see then if sales do come through we will try to get our original establishment or search for a new one i'll keep you posted until then thanks if we sold 100 tickets which is less then half the people in the facebook group we would break even if we sold tickets for $15 cyclists are crossing at 3900 south they won't be going over the bridge i agreethat would be crazy on that bridge the race director is going to work with the web guy to update the maps on the website thanks for the feedback come join us it will be fun collin glad to see you made it to the event i hope you had fun & that your kids did too what did you think of everything we hope to grow it year after year into a really fun community event i asked the my family for their feedback as well i really liked the venue library square is a nice place to have the finish festival the "corral" for rounding up the kids could have been better it got a little crowded in there and it wasn't really a corral it was just dumping the kids onto the sidewalk if your child didn't know where to go it could be easy for them to get lost maybe there is a spot for it on the north side of the finishers chute it would have been nice to have some smaller shirts on the website it says the race was designed for kids ages 5-12 but i saw quite a few kids smaller than that with the course being so short it's a great one to bring kids in the 2+ range but the smallest shirt size is really big for the kids also my kid didn't like the creamies at the finish since it was so cold that day it looked like a lot of kids liked them so we may be in a minority here due to the timing of the race your weather is going to be a little variable but it would be awesome to have warm and cold stuff at the finish all in all it was a great day and i plan to do it again next year and promote it to my friends i think so if you ever want in introduction to someone please let me know how are things pretty good i'm still working on my data science skills so much to learn kind of wish i was in a group that was more focused on it we do mostly bi stuff which is more basic hmm i saw montecello utah from up here i followed the road almost in to telluride it was kind of neat to know where i actually was for a moment i lived here for 15 years with my best friends it's typically really quiet around here it's a nice area so i cant pick up any girls off the side of the road- but what about girls at church they said the suspect is blonde so better just stick to brunettes to be safe sent a message today waiting to hear back is it diana bateman hi collin i'm applying for a position at myriad do you mind if i put your name as a referral for the company absolutely what position are you applying for i dont think it's generally a choice but if someone is a 70 on my scale they may choose to be exclusively homosexual rather than bisexual even though there "score" suggests that they could be with women interesting model as far as mike goes i don't think i've ever seen him express any interest in women whatsoever guys did you send david your ndas i will in an hour done not too bad so far i just started managerial accounting last night so that should be interesting how's your school going pretty good still trying to lock down an internship but it's still early she's in my ward actually i dont know her very well though hey collin i hope you have had a great day and not too much stress with your experiments and all i have a quick question for yais it still okay if i borrow your sleeping bag if not it's okay but if it is okay that would be absolutely awesome let me know and i hope tomorrow is a good day for youthanks a bunch sure thing it should be in the hall closet either hanging up or inside of my backpack why salaries don't seem that high where ever i look you make more in marketing and finance not too badi really can't run very much but i've been trying to find other fitness alternatives usually about 25 miles is my max anymore which is really sad but at least i can do that i hear you my ankle is still not better and all i can do is 2 miles no problem sorry it didn't work out :-/ thought you might like this it's great to keep up the old spanish skills thanks i will on saturday that survey was way too long i would rather take one of those 2 than drew who's usually fairly busy with either work or something else but if you want to take him im down with any team decision i'll talk to him and get a feel for his schedule oh really where are you going this summer either a startup in la called vroozin or a plastics manufacturing company in ohio called a schulman i'm leaning toward ohio congratulations thanks and then c is simple it is just the dominant which is 25ee if i am wrong on that one i am just going to cry i'll get the tissues let's do it veronica and the kids have never been there before it will be a good challenge for them :-) my parents are in town this weekend but maybe the saturday after i still have more video that i haven't looked through yet i'll put it up on facebook if i find something especially juicy it's about time you accepted my friend request i was beginning to wonder where you were how are you doing old friend hey a little bird told me you were thinking about applying to hbs this year i can create it im on the page now ok go for it i can run the online order stuff if you guys don't mind i know you guys have done a lot with this and i'd be happy to take something off your plate rofl that sounds horrible i don't want to give up my sundays i'm at byu it wouldn't be right if i didn't make some attempt at missionary work ok have a good day i love you love you too thank you i'm sure you know not to send him follow up emails though a thank you is fine but i wouldn't send anymore than that to him who is brad spagnolo i dont know if im going to add a ticket thing yet to the eventbrite cause we are not for sure about the venue yet or should i so people can register and also pay for their ticket david and cody sevier are in our class i still have a 2002 class t-shirt and both of there names are on it i think it would be a good idea just to set something up on event brite we can change the venue later if needs be but at least this way you can get more money in hand and have a better idea of who is actually going to show up that's cool they are in peoria illinois right yeah nah is it your birthday seems soi ll ask our stk councilman tom baird󾍇 no worries rod i sent that back in 2012 alright i will be there at 11:30 i am not working that day so i can wait if you need to go later i have all the time in the world sounds good could you resend that email with our guesstimated run times to my home email address i never forwarded the one you sent to my cargill address to my home itsjewlz@coxnet sent interesting you seemed a bit concerned about his reaction when we talked before he's also an internalizer so it's hard to know what he's really thinking hahahhaha well done hey mind if i stop by and ask you a few questions about the apm jobs thanks let me know if you hear anything word travels slow out here on utah i have a distant connection that just retired last week i might be able to connect you if interested wow karen and the kids coming with you we

mystery canyon that ends with a rappel into the narrows right next to the waterfall at the end of the narrows could be fun too sweet thanks sem isn't my area of expertise but it looks like the group is good for all manner of digital marketing yeah i gave a talk there a few months ago on recommender systems if you want introductions to some of the people let me know and i'm happy to help you could probably speak there as well if you were interested could be a good source of clients ha-ha thanks for being understanding my in-laws live here in nm so i'll be down here again sometime soon maybe we

http://wwwmapmyruncom/routes/view/425043420 i can spot this trail from the road i'm not sure where it goes exactly but i've seen runners on it thought i might check it out either that trail or i've never done the pipeline trail in millcreek canyon either it's a popular running trail no- having a baby in three days- i've been a little distracted wow didn't realize it was so close you definitely have other things to take care of 😃 best of luck lol good mindset just a heads up though if we sell 100 tickets at $30 each that means we have $3000 to spend since the reunion is going to only cost $1300 what do you plan on doing with the other $1700 i just had an idea let's offer a discounted ticket if people order within the next week say $25 we can send the four people who already ordered a check for the difference what do you guys think of having sarita's cater there's nothing that says monte vista like a sarita's rolled taco i have a consulting job for the summer at memorial hospital

i know this is a weird question but i am taking an anthropology class online and i am struggling a little bit with a hw question i have tried to find a tutor but they only have those for math and engineering anywho if i sent you a question with my work could you check the answer i figured since you are a scientist you could have it done in like two seconds if not do you know of a good website

the house huffing and puffing to find everything was ok hey collin- i was just reading an email you sent out- and this question popped in my head what do you know about grandpa's cancer the kind how long he had it i read the autopsy report after he died it's been a few years but what i remember is they found a smallish cancer in his duodenum the part where the small intestine joins the large intestine given his advanced age when it was discovered it probably doesn't put us at any higher risk for colon cancer than the general population he might have had it for a while because i'm guessing he wasn't the kind of guy who got regular colonoscopies hehe u ain't kidding :) can't wait to see yall one way or the other ohh do we have a list of deceased i really wanna do something for that possibly dates too mrs pyle dies she was my english teacher i don't remember the date though not much 20%so who knows i thought you had done it before awesome i'm looking for someone in hirevue that i
